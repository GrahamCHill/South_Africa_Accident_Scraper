SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to police
stations between July and September 2017 and 2018 using the CHoCOR For. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-roadworthy and
un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued from the
National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), Law Enforcement and Road Safety
information. Furthermore, it includes information about Population growth using the
2018 mid-year population estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to collect
fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the primary
source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation with a list of all recorded
fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms
from various police stations. Road Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes

and verifies the data to compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the Corporation
either by fax, email or through the phone.

2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical report.
There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

10

--- Page 13 ---
2.4 ~Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal crashes
only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to collect scientific base

facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Road Safety

The Corporation develops programmes to coordinate and monitor the implementation of
the programmes across the nine (9) provinces. The reports compiled by the different
implementing agents namely youth structure, community-based structure and interest
group (Freight company, etc.) are used as the source of data.

2.6 Law Enforcement

The Law Enforcement Unit is primarily responsible for the harmonization and alignment
of road traffic enforcement operations within the three spheres of government. The

data is collected through reporting templates.

2.7. Sample

Sampling is not applicable for fatal crashes routine or administrative data as the data is
collected as they occurred within the country from all nine (9) provinces. There is no

sampling for Road Safety and Law Enforcement.

2.8 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being used by
Road Traffic Information unit to record fatal road crash data on daily basis.

Road Safety and Law Enforcement use the following tools amongst others for
administrative data collection: questionnaires, templates, reports, registers and

11

--- Page 14 ---
presentations. Provinces record information on National Rollout Enforcement Plan
(NREP) and EMISA forms while Road Traffic Inspectorate records information on
Inspectorate forms. These reports are submitted to RTMC on monthly basis for

consolidation of a National report.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatai crashes Per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars and
LDV‘s with contributions of 48.1% and 19.6% respectively during 2018. The two vehicle
types may contribute to high number of fatalities for passengers.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows: human factors
(defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are valid for all users
regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle itself and they cover
issues around mechanical failures; and environment (inciude limited visibility, poorly
marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road,
the state of the road and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for July - September 2018 showed that human factors contributed
63% to the occurrence of fatal crashes followed by roads and environmental factors at
33.9% and vehicle factors with a contribution of 3.1%.

2 ROAD SAFETY

2.1 Monitoring the implementation of the National Road Safety

Strategy

The Road Traffic Management Corporation under the stewardship of the
Department of Transport is committed to reducing road crashes
together with enhancing safe roads in South Africa. As part of this
commitment, the RTMC developed the National Road Safety Strategy
that embodies the principles of the Safe Systems’ approach, NDP and
gives effect to the five pillars of the United Nations Decade of Action.

During the financial period 2018/2019 monitoring on the
implementation of the National Road Safety Strategy will take place and
which will result in two Monitoring Reports.

2.2 Youth programme developed, implemented, monitored

Road safety programmes are undertaken specifically targeting the youth.
Road traffic injuries are the leading kiiler of young people globally. Youth
aged 15-29 years old are the most affected. This age group is clearly
identified as a high-risk population globally because their behaviour is
strongly associated with expectations and social Pressures that promote
risk taking on the road, such as not using safety devices, speeding and

drinking and driving.

3.1 Law Enforcement Arrests

Substabce abuse contributes significantly to htehigher rate of road fatalities
and crashes in the country, this is evidence through various statisctis and
analysis report on road fatalities that majority of drivers of motor vehicles have
consumed alcohol prior the actual trips of vehicles. As a result, law
enforcement authorities mounted interventions targeting alcohol at various
identified harzardous location. This is further illustrated in the below figure in
comparison with the same period in the previous year.

In relation to excessive speeding, analysis of the below figure indicate that
Free State has recorded the highest arrests followed by Gauteng on excessive
speed compared to other provinces. The reason for the high number of arrests
in the Free State v/s Gauteng with high number of speed notices as a results
of Free state utilizing physical intervention and Gauteng reliant on automation.

Comanains

In relation to operating permits/licences in Kwa-Zulu Natal, the province
focused on increasing public transport operations in order to reduce public
transport violance in the province. The said operations resulted into the

province arresting more road users for driving without permits.

Due to motorists transporting goods and Passengers to foreign countries, a

challenge of not paying traffic fines is increasing hence the increased warrants

of arrests are issued by the magistrate.

A figure below provides breakdown of arrests per province per arrests. There

is also a sharp increase in Warrants that was executed during this period.
