2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report seeks to provide the road crash statistics. The performance is for
the period between October to December 2021. The performance per each

focus areas have been provided below.
Road Crashes Data

A total number of 3 637 fatalities were recorded for the period between October
to December 2021 from 3 000 fatal crashes. An increase of 5% has been
recorded for fatal crashes and 7% increase for fatalities. The most affected road

users were pedestrians and passengers.

A total number of twenty-seven (27) major crashes were reported and
investigated during this period. One-hundred and seventy-one (171) persons
were killed, and ninety-five (95) persons sustained injuries in the major

crashes.
Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 259 475 (2,04%) from 12 697
733 on 31 December 2020 to 12 957 208 vehicles on 31 December 2021

The number of learner driving licences issued increased by 131 384 (13.83%)
from 950 231 on 31 December 2020 to 1 081 615 on 31 December 2021.

--- Page 10 ---

The number of driving licences issued increased by 497 413 (3.57%) from
13 918 881 on 31 December 2020 to 14 416 294 as of 31 December 2021.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued increased by 100

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between October and December 2021 using the CHoCOR Forms.
In addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, driving
licences and professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic

Information System (NaTIS).

1.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation with
a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and furthermore, the Corporation
receives the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic
Management Corporation captures, processes, and verifies the data to compile

a report.

1.2. Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to

the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

11

--- Page 12 ---
Za

Road atic
1.3. Data processing

The data is captured, processed, and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with

provinces for validation purpose.

1.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.
1.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being

used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

2. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes. The section will

encompass the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality data per road user group and major crashes.

2.1. Number of fatal crashes

This section provides a comparison of road fatal crashes during 3" quarters in
2020 and 2021. An increase of 138 (5%) has been observed when the two

quarters are compared. On a provincial level, only three (3) provinces recorded

a decrease while the other six (6) provinces recorded an increase in this regard.

The highest percentage change was recorded for Western Cape with 40%

followed by Northern Cape with 29%.

Figure 1: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per province
The figure above provides percentage distribution of fatal crashes per province.
The provinces with the highest contribution of more than 20% are Gauteng and
KwaZulu Natal with 22% and 20% respectively for year 2021. Eastern Cape

has recorded a decrease of 2% whilst Western Cape has recorded an increase
of 3%.

2.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the crashes per day of the week is given in the figure below. Most
crashes are still recorded as from Friday until Monday for both reporting
periods. However, from the above mentioned three (3) days a slight decrease
has been observed for Sunday and Friday. Whilst an increase of 2% has been
recorded for Saturday. In 2020 the three day made a contribution of 60% whilst

in 2021 62% has been recorded for crashes occurred from Friday to Sunday.

The figure above depicts a comparison between fatal crashes per time of day
for the 2020 and 2021. Majority of the fatal crashes were recorded between
14:00 to 23:00 with 4% and above for both years. However, most fatal crashes
were recorded between time slot 19:00 to 21:00 with more than 8% for 2020
and 2021. The figure indicates the information to be skewed to the right of

which means that most fatal crashes are recorded in the late hours of the day.

cars recorded a decrease of 4% similarly LDV’s recorded a decrease of 3%.

2.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle
itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and environment
(include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road signs, sudden
changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road and weather

conditions).

Same as the previous year, October to December 2021 still show that human
factors remain a challenge with a contribution of 84% of which is less than 85%
recorded in 2020. The roads and environmental factors recorded slight

decrease of 1%, while vehicle factors remained an increase of 2%.

3. ROAD FATALITIES

The section covers the data in relation to road fatalities. Fatalities are defined
as when a person or persons that are killed during or immediately after a crash,
or death within 30 days after a crash happened as a direct result of such a
crash. The section will encompass the number of fatalities and percentage

distribution per road user, gender, race and per age.

4. MAJOR CRASHES INVESTIGATED

This section provides for all the major crashes for the period under review.
Major crashes are defined as Crashes where five (5) or more people died,
Crashes involving vehicles carrying dangerous goods/ hazardous chemicals
where there is a fatality and a spillage of the dangerous goods/ hazardous
chemicals and lastly any crash that the Corporation deems necessary to

investigate.

The information in tables and figures above shows that on a national basis the
general overall mobility in terms of the number of persons per road vehicle
(vehicles that can reasonably transport passengers -— motorcars, minibuses,
buses, motorcycles and LDV’s “bakkies”), improved by -2.09% from a national
average of 5.36 persons per vehicle at the end of December 2019 to 5.48
persons per vehicle at the end of December 2020. Whilst from the end of
December 2020 to December 2021 slight decrease of -0.03% has been

recorded in this regard.

Although they do show some improvement, the “least mobile” Provinces remain
Eastern Cape with 10.34 persons per vehicle; followed by the Limpopo with
9.58 persons per vehicle at the end of December 2021. The “most mobile”
Provinces are Kwa-Zulu Natal and the North West with an average of 8.01 and
