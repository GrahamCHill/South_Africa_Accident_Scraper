The number of registered vehicles decreased by 3 896 (0,03%) from
12 701 629 on 31 December 2019 to 12 697 733 vehicles on 31 December
2020.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 219 798 (18.79%)
from 1 170 029 on 31 December 2019 to 950 231 on 31 December 2020.

--- Page 10 ---
The number of driving licences issued increased by 371 820 (2.74%) from
13 547 061 on 31 December 2019 to 13 918 881 as of 31 December 2020.

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between October and December 2020 using the CHoCOR Forms.
In addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, driving
licences and professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic

Information System (NaTIS).

1.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation with
a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and furthermore, the Corporation
receives the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic
Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to compile

a report.

1.2. Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to

the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

11

--- Page 12 ---
Za

Road atic
1.3. Data processing

The data is captured, processed and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with

provinces for validation purpose.

1.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.
1.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being

used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

2. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes. The section will
encompass the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality data per road user group and major crashes.

2.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison during the 3% quarters in 2019 and
2020. There was an increase of 1 (0,03%) in comparison to the two quarters
of 2019 and 2020 nationally. On a provincial level, only three (3) provinces
recorded a decrease while the other six (6) provinces recorded an increase in
the number of fatal crashes. The highest increase was recorded for Eastern
Cape with 11% followed by North West with 11%.

The figure above provides percentage distribution of fatal crashes per province.
The provinces with the highest contribution of more than 18% were KwaZulu
Natal and Gauteng 20% respectively for year 2020, followed by Eastern Cape
and Limpopo with 14% and 11%, respectively for 2020.

2.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the crashes per day of the week is given in the figure below. Most
crashes are still recorded as from Friday until Monday for both reporting
periods. However, a slight decrease has been observed for Sunday, Monday

The figure above depicts a comparison between fatal crashes per time of day
for the 2019 and 2020. Majority of the fatal crashes were recorded between
16:00 to 23:00 taking 5% as a base for 2020 including time slot 00:00 to
01:00. However, most fatal crashes were recorded between time slot 19:00 to
21:00 with 8% respectively during 2020. Despite the COVID-19 restrictions the

trend remains the same.

2.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle
itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and environment
(include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road signs, sudden
changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road and weather

conditions).

The fatal crashes for October to December 2020 still show that human factors
remain a challenge with a contribution of 85% of which is less than 87%
recorded in 2019. The roads and environmental factors recorded slight increase

of 2%, while vehicle factors remained constant with 5% for the two years.

The section covers the data in relation to road fatalities. Fatalities are defined

as when a person or persons that are killed during or immediately after a crash,

or death within 30 days after a crash happened as a direct result of such a

crash. The section will encompass the number of fatalities and percentage

distribution per road user, gender, race and per age.

Figure 17: Number of major crashes, fatalities, and injuries

The above figure and table indicate the number of major crashes investigated
in line to the three categories namely: major fatal crashes, fatalities and
injuries sustained during the quarter. A total number of twenty-seven (27) fatal
crashes, one hundred and seventy-one (171) fatalities and ninety-five (95)

injuries were recorded for the period under review.

There was a 21% decrease in the number of crashes, 13% decrease in fatalities
and 58% decrease in the number of injuries sustained in major crashes during
the 3 Quarter of the 2020/ 2021 Financial Year compared to the same period
the previous year. This can be largely attributed to the Lockdown Restrictions
imposed as from 27 March 2020 from the COVID-19 Pandemic. During this
period, there was a significant reduction in major crashes.

Figure 18: Major crashes per crash types

The above figure depicts the crash types that were recorded during the period
under review. Most crashes occurred due to head-on, single vehicle overturned
and T-Bone. The absolute figures indicate a decrease from 8 to 7 times for
Head-on whilst single vehicle overturning reduced from 7 to 6. These might be
due to the road designs in the country and other contributory factors.

The information in tables and figures above shows that on a national basis the
general overall mobility in terms of the number of persons per road vehicle
(vehicles that can reasonably transport passengers -— motorcars, minibuses,
buses, motorcycles and LDV’s “bakkies”), improved by 0.10% from a national
average of 5.37 persons per vehicle at the end of December 2018 to 5.36
persons per vehicle at the end of December 2019. From the end of December
2019 to December 2020 the improvement shows a decrease of 2.09%, from

5.36 to 5.48 persons per vehicle.

Although they do show some improvement, the “least mobile” Provinces remain
Eastern Cape with 9.79 persons per vehicle; followed by the Limpopo with 9.55
persons per vehicle at the end of December 2020. The “most mobile” Provinces
are Kwa-Zulu Natal and the North West with an average of 7.81 and 7.57

Un-roadworthy vehicles is defined as those of which the owners failed to submit

the vehicles for compulsory annual roadworthy tests (including buses, minibus

taxis and freight transport vehicles) or on change of ownership. Un-licenced

vehicles are those of which the owners failed to renew the vehicle licences

within the time frame allowed.

On a national basis the total number of vehicles that are either un-roadworthy,
un-licenced or both increased by 105 543 (9.91%) from 1 064 623 vehicles as
