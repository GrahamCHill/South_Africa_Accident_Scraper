DATA MANAGEMENT

Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the
primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provides the Corporation with a list
of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the Corporation receive
the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic Management
Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data in order to compile a report.

Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are submitted to the
Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

Data processing

Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) captures, processes and verifies all
the data received and captured in order to compile a consolidate report. There is a
continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.
