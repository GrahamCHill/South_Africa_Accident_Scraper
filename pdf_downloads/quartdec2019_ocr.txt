2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report seeks to provide the road crash statistics. The performance is for
the period between October to December 2019. The performance per each
focus areas have been provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 3 416 fatalities were recorded for the period between October
to December 2019 from 2 861 fatal crashes. That resulted in an increase of 6%
fatalities from 2018. The most affected road users were pedestrians and
passengers.

A total number of thirty-four (34) major crashes were reported and investigated
during this period. One-hundred and ninety-five (195) persons were killed and
two-hundred and twenty-seven (227) persons sustained injuries in the major
crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 238 650 (1.91%) from 12 462
979 on 31 December 2018 to 12 701 629 vehicles on 31 December 2019.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 1 759 (0.15%) from
1 171 788 on 31 December 2018 to 1 170 029 on 31 December 2019. The
number of driving licences issued increased by 491 744 (3.77%) from 13 055
317 on 31 December 2018 to 13 547 061 as of 31 December 2019.

SECTION A
INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between October and December 2019 using the CHoCOR Forms.
In addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, driving
licences and professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic
Information System (NaTIS).

1.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation with
a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and furthermore, the Corporation
receives the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic
Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to compile
a report.

1.2. Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to
the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

Road Traffic
1.3. Data processing

The data is captured, processed and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with
provinces for validation purpose.

1.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to
collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

1.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being
used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

2. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes. The section will
encompass the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,
fatality data per road user group and major crashes.

2.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison during the 3™ quarters in 2018 and
2019. There was an increase of 286 (11%) in comparison to the two quarters
of 2018 and 2019 nationally. On a provincial level, only two (2) provinces
recorded a decrease while the other seven (7) provinces recorded an increase
in the number of fatal crashes. The highest increase was recorded for Northern
Cape with 48% followed by Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal with 33% and
25% respectively.

The provinces with the highest contribution of more than 15% were KwaZulu
Natal and Gauteng with 20%, followed by Eastern Cape and Limpopo with 13%
and 11%, respectively for 2019.

2.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week
The details of the crashes per day of the week is given in the figure below. Most

crashes are still recorded as from Friday until Monday for both reporting
periods. It’s clear that the country do record less fatal crashes during the week.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and LDV’s with contributions of 42% and 18%, respectively for 2019. However,
motor cars recorded a decrease of 4% while LDV’s recorded a decrease of 2,5%
in comparison of the two periods. The two vehicle types may contribute to high
number of fatalities for passengers.

2.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle
itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and environment
(include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road signs, sudden
changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road and weather
conditions).

The fatal crashes for October to December 2019 showed that human factors
contributed 87% as compared to 90% recorded during October to December
2018. The roads and environmental factors recorded 6% in 2018 and 8% in
2019 which shows a significant increase of 2%, while vehicle factors increased
with 1% from 4% in 2018 to 5% in 2019.

The figure above shows that jay-walking contribution to fatal crashes has

2018 to 30% in 2019. However, hit and run increased with a contribution of
5% from 14% in 2018 to 19% in 2019. Speeding was still a challenge as it also
contributed to fatal crashes. The jay-walking and hit and run as depicted above
correlate to a high number of fatalities for pedestrians.

3. ROAD FATALITIES

The section covers the data in relation to road fatalities. Fatalities are defined
as when a person or persons that are killed during or immediately after a crash,
or death within 30 days after a crash happened as a direct result of such a
crash. The section will encompass the number of fatalities and percentage
distribution per road user, gender, race and per age.

The information in tables and figures above shows that on a national basis the
general overall mobility in terms of the number of persons per road vehicle
(vehicles that can reasonably transport passengers - motorcars, minibuses,
buses, motorcycles and LDV’s “bakkies”), improved by 0.78% from a national
average of 5.43 persons per vehicle at the end of December 2017 to 5.38
persons per vehicle at the end of December 2018. From the end of December
2018 to December 2019 the improvement shows a decrease of 0.09%, from
5.38 to 5.38 persons per vehicle.

Although they do show some improvement, the “least mobile” Provinces remain
Eastern Cape with 9.59 persons per vehicle; followed by the Limpopo with 9.49
persons per vehicle at the end of December 2019. The “most mobile” Provinces
are Kwa-Zulu Natal and the North West with an average of 7.78 and 7.55
persons per vehicle respectively at the end of December 2019.
