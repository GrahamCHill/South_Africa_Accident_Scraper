2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report seeks to provide the final road crash statistics. The performance is

A total number of twenty-one (21) major crashes were reported and
investigated during this period. One-hundred and twenty-five (125) persons
were killed, and one-hundred and fifty-one (151) persons sustained injuries in

the major crashes.

SECTION A
. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between April and June 2019 and 2021 using the CHoCOR
Forms. In addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles,
driving licenses and professional driving permits issued from the National
Traffic Information System (NaTIS). Furthermore, it includes information about
population growth using the 2021 mid-year population estimates from
Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to

the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

10

--- Page 11 ---
7

2.3. Data processing

The data is captured, processed, and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with

provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being

used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

3. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes. The section will
encompass the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality data per road user group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison during the first quarters in 2019 and
2021. An increase of 436 (19%) has been recorded in comparison to the two
quarters of 2019 and 2021 nationally. On a provincial level, all the nine (9)
provinces recorded an increase in this regard. The highest figure in the
absolute figures was recorded for KwaZulu Natal with 166 fatal crashes

followed by Gauteng with 104 fatal crashes.

Figure 1: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per province

The figure above provides percentage distribution of fatal crashes per province.
The provinces with the highest contribution of more than 15% were Gauteng
and KwaZulu-Natal 21% and 20% respectively for 2021.

3.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the crashes per day of the week is given in the figure below.
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday remain the most affected day of the week by
fatal crashes for both quarters in 2019 and 2021. However, a reduction of 3%
has been recorded for Saturday whilst a slight increase has been recorded for

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for April to June 2021 showed that human factors contributed
84% as compared to 88% recorded during April to June 2019. The roads and
environmental factors recorded 8% in 2019 and 12% in 2021 that showed a

significant increase of 4%.
