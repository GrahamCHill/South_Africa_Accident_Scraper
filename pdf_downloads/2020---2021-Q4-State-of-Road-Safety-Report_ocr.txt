1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report aims at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced

vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

--- Page 8 ---
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period

January to March 2021. The performance is as provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 2 550 fatalities were recorded for the period between
January - March 2021 from 2 155 fatal crashes. As a result, a decrease of 3%
was recorded for fatalities. The most affected road user group during 2021

remains to be the pedestrians followed by passengers.

A total number of twenty (20) major crashes were reported and investigated
for the period under review. One-hundred and twenty-seven (127) persons
were killed, and eighty-six (86) persons sustained injuries in these major
crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 206 218 (1.64%) from 12 541
566 on 31 March 2019 to 12 747 784 vehicles on 31 March 2021.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 246 903 (21.07%)
from 1 172 073 on 31 March 2019 to 925 170 on 31 March 2021.

--- Page 9 ---
The number of driving licences issued increased by 861 323 (6.54%) from
13 174 103 on 31 March 2019 to 14 035 426 as of 31 March 2021.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued increased by 110
602 (10.19%) from 1085 588 on 31 March 2019 to 1 196 190 on 31 March
2021.

--- Page 10 ---
SECTION A

1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between January and March of 2019 and 2021 using the
CHoCOR Form. In addition, the report includes information about registered
vehicles, un-roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and
professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic Information

System (NaTIS), Law Enforcement and Road Safety information.

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the

Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

--- Page 11 ---
2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical
report. There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation

purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

--- Page 12 ---
3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which
encompasses the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality information per road user group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. A decrease of
49 (2%) has been recorded for the periods under review. With exception of
Western Cape, the rest of other provinces recorded a decrease with regards to
the absolute figures. The highest decrease was recorded for Mpumalanga and

Free State with 18% and 17%, respectively.

Road Traffic

The Figure above indicates the percentage distribution per province of fatal
crashes for the two quarters. The provinces with the highest percentage
distributions are Gauteng with 20% followed by KwaZulu Natal with 18% for
2021. Western Cape recorded an increase of 4% from 9% during 2019 to 13%

during 2021. However, other provinces have recorded a slight decrease.

3.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the fatal crashes per day of the week is given in the table below.
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday remain the most days of the week with more
fatal crashes recorded compared to other days. About 60% of fatal crashes
were recorded for the three days for 2019 whilst about 59% were recorded for

the same days in 2021

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows:
human factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that
are valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

Figure 8: Percentage distribution of road and environmental factors

The figure above depicts that about 21% of fatal crashes occurred as a result
of road surface being wet/slippery during 2019, followed by poor visibility due
to smoke/fog/rain and sharp bend with contributions of 16% and 13%
respectively. However, a significant decrease has been observed for road
surface and poor visibility. Road surface has decreased from 21% to 15% in
2021, whilst visibility decreased from 16% to 7% in 2021.

5. MAJOR CRASHES

This section provides for all the major crashes for the period under review.
Major crashes are defined as Crashes where five (5) or more people died,
crashes involving vehicles carrying dangerous goods / hazardous chemicals
where there is a fatality and a spillage of the dangerous goods / hazardous

chemicals, and any crash that the Corporation deems necessary to investigate.

5.1. Number of major crashes

A total number of twenty (20) major crashes were reported and investigated
for the period under review. One-hundred and twenty-seven (127) persons
were killed, and eighty-six (86) persons sustained injuries in these major

crashes.

The figure below indicates the number of fatalities and injuries sustained
during the period under review compared to the previous year. During the
current period there were less major crashes reported and investigated and
