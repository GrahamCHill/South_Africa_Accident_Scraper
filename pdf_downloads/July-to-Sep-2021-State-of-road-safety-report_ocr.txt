4. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period July -

September 2021. The performance is provided below.
Road Crashes Data

A total number of 3 093 fatalities were recorded for the period between July -
September 2019 from 2 642 fatal crashes. As a result, there was a decrease of 18%
fatalities from 2019 to 2021. The most affected road user group during 2021 is the

pedestrians. However, passengers recorded a slight decrease of 4% from 27% to 31%.

A total number of twenty-four (24) major crashes were reported and investigated for
the period under review. One-hundred and sixty-two (162) persons were killed in the
major crashes and one-hundred and forty-four (144) persons sustained injuries in these

major crashes.
Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 254 291 (2.04%) from 12 703 720 on
30 September 2019 to 12 958 011 vehicles as of 30 September 2021.

The number of learner driving licenses issued decreased by 252 367(21,30%) from
1 184 713 as at 30 September 2019 to 932 367 as at 30 September 2021.

The number of driving licenses issued increased by 866 339 (6,45%) from 13 423 683
as of 30 September 2019 to 14 290 022 as of 30 September 2021.

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to police
stations between July and September 2019 and 2021 using the CHoCOR Form. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-roadworthy and
un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued from the
National Traffic Information System (NaTIS). Furthermore, it includes information about
population growth using the 2021 mid-year population estimates from Statistics South
Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to collect
fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the primary
source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation with a list of all recorded
fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms
from various police stations. Road Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes

and verifies the data to compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the Corporation

either by fax, email or through the phone.

--- Page 10 ---
y,

Road Traffic

Sement Corporation

2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical report.

There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal crashes
only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to collect scientific base

facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Sample

Sampling is not applicable for fatal crashes routine or administrative data as the data is

collected as they occurred within the country from all nine (9) provinces.

2.6 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being used by

Road Traffic Information unit to record fatal road crash data on daily basis.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which encompasses the
number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality information per road

user group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. There was an increase of
464 (21%) from 2 178 to 2 642 in comparison to quarter 2 of 2019 and 2021.
However, on a provincial level all provinces recorded a decrease in this regard except
for Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal, North West and Western Cape. The highest increase was

recorded for KwaZulu Natal with 79% followed by Gauteng with 66%.

3.2 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the fatal crashes per day of the week is given in the table below. Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday remain the most affected day of the week by fatal crashes for
both 2019 and 2021. About 49% of crashes were recorded on Saturday and Sunday

during 2019 whilst about 42% were recorded in 2021 for the same two days.

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars and
LDV’s with contributions of 41% and 17% respectively during 2021. However, the two

has recorded a decrease in this regard.

3.6 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows: human factors
(defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are valid for all users
regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle itself and they cover
issues around mechanical failures; and environment (include limited visibility, poorly
marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road,

the state of the road and weather conditions).

The human factors remained to be the highest amongst the three contributory factors.
The figure below shows that fatal crashes for July - September 2021 occurred due to
human factors with a contribution of 89% with an increase of 6%. Whilst roads and

vehicle factors recorded a reduction of less than 4% respectively.

5. MAJOR CRASHES

This section provides for all the major crashes for the period under review. Major
crashes are defined as Crashes where five (5) or more people died, crashes involving
vehicles carrying dangerous goods / hazardous chemicals where there is a fatality and a
spillage of the dangerous goods / hazardous chemicals, and any crash that the

Corporation deems necessary to investigate.

5.1 Number of major crashes

A total number of twenty-four (24) major crashes were reported and investigated for
the period under review. One-hundred and sixty-two (162) persons were killed in the
major crashes and one-hundred and forty-four (144) persons sustained injuries in these

major crashes.

The figure below indicates the number of major crashes recorded and investigated,
number of fatalities and injuries sustained during the period under review in comparison
with the previous year’s quarter. During the current period under review the number of
the major crashes reported has decreased with three cases as compared to 27 reported
in 2019/20. Comparing 2019/20 and 2021/22 with regards to the fatalities its clear that
the country its going back to the normal trend as there is a slide reduction with one
case from 163 to 162.
