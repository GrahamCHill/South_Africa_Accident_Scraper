SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between January and March 2018 using the CHoCOR Forms. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-
roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and professional driving
permits issued from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), Law
Enforcement and Road Safety information. Furthermore, its includes
information about population growth using the 2017 mid-year population
estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

ii

wa.
Menigement Cipro

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to
the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

2.3 Data processing

The data is captured, processed and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with

provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to
collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Road Safety

The Corporation develops programmes to coordinate and monitor the
implementation of the programmes across the 9 provinces. The reports
compiled by the different implementing agents namely youth structure,
community-based structure and interest group (Freight company, etc) are
used as the source of data.

2.6 Law Enforcement

The Law Enforcement Unit is primarily responsible for the harmonization and
alignment of road traffic enforcement operations within the three spheres of
government. The data is collected through reporting templates.

12

--- Page 15 ---
2.7. Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being
used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

Road Safety and Enforcement use the following tools among others for
administrative data collection questionnaires, templates, reports, registers and
presentations. Provinces record information on National Rollout Enforcement
Plan (NREP) and EMISA forms while Road Traffic Inspectorate records
information on Inspectorate forms, these reports are submitted to RTMC on
monthly basis for consolidation of a National report.

3.2. Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for January to March 2018 showed that human factors
contributed 89.2% as compared to 74.8% recorded during January to March
2017. The roads and environmental factors recorded 19.1% in 2017 and 6.4%
in 2018 which shows a significant reduction of 12.7%.

The 365 Road Safety Plan prescribes targets for stop and check as well as
drunken driving arrests per province. It is through this report the unit can
measure performance of provinces against the set targets as well as be able to
evaluate impact and possible intervention seeking areas. It also assists in
identifying areas of best practices which can be followed up for possible roll-out
to other provinces and authorities. The target set for the for traffic law
enforcement authorities to stop and check vehicles for roadworthy status is 1
100 000 per month and has been divided amongst provinces following the
vehicle population as well as number of authorities per province.

As result of all 3468 498 and 3 620 812 vehicles which were stopped and
checked for roadworthiness in 2017 and 2018 respectively, it is evident that
road users do not comply with the National Road Traffic Act, Act 93 of 1996 as
shown in the table below. The analysis indicate that speed, driving without a

Un-roadworthy vehicles contribute to road crashes leading into the loss of
lives, this is clearly prescribed in the section 3F(a) or Section 3 I(a) of the
National Road Traffic Act, Act 93 of 1996 that when a vehicle is not roadworthy
be discontinued for road use and be taken to a testing station to be re-tested
for roadworthiness. The report of the period under review depicts that most
vehicles were discontinued in KwaZulu Natal, Gauteng and Mpumalanga while
Limpopo and Mpumalanga recorded the highest number of impounded

vehicles. Reasons below provide indication on discontinuation and

impoundments of vehicles:

« people travelling from Gauteng via N3 to visit various tourist destinations
in KZN

people travelling from KZN to GP due to schools re-opening

* people travelling on N1,N3 and N4 between GP, KZN and to attend
religious pilgrims during Easter

e Mozambique immigrants travelling back home via N4 (Mpumalanga:
Lebombo) during holidays and school closures

e Zimbabwean immigrants travelling back home via Ni (Limpopo: Beit
Bridge) during holidays and school closures

e People visiting tourist destinations in MP travelling via N4

All movements mentioned above results into increased traffic volumes with
other road users failing to obtain necessary road permits which ultimately lead
to their vehicles being impounded and some being discontinued during
operations as they are found to be un-roadworthy. Figures below provides

breakdown of vehicles impounded and discontinued.

3.1 Law Enforcement Arrests

Drunk and driving is one of the biggest threads to Road Safety in the country
since it slows reaction time and distorts the driver's vision. This offence has
implications where one could lose life, be prosecuted, vehicle damage, or
imprisonment depending on alcohol levels found in the blood when tested by
law enforcement officers. In order to reduce high rate of drunk and driving, law
enforcement agencies took responsibility to conduct operations, targeting
areas and events where most alcohol is consumed, as well as routes used by

4. CONCLUSIONS

Based on the road crashes and fatalities provided in this report it indicates
that our challenges was driver and passenger fatalities during this period
under review. Furthermore, passengers and pedestrians between age group
0-9 is becoming a serious change as they have increased in comparison of
the two periods. The time the crashes happens is also of great concerns.

In conclusion, the following are recommended to address the identified

challenges:

Road Safety education intervention plan targeting all road users

needs to be strengthened, and target implementations where high

pedestrian fatalities occurred. Consideration on the activity type will
also be done.

« Intensified marketing and Communication campaign in Community
radio stations to reach rural communities and pedestrians so as to
improve their level of awareness.

e The need to intensify monitoring and evaluation system during the
peak periods

« Increase Law Enforcement capacity to ensure intelligence deployment

in all critical areas, and at the right time
