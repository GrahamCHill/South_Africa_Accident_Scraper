1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The review of the State of Road Safety in South Africa over the last 12 months
is split into two, from January to March and from April to December. This is due
to the National wide COVID-19 lockdown that took effect from 27 March 2020.
This is because almost all economic activities were halted to reduce the impact
of the pandemic and as such, the road traffic environment saw significantly

reduced volumes on South African roads.

Furthermore, additional regulations which positively affected safety on South
African roads, notably, the ban of consumable alcohol and night-time driving. As
such, quarter on quarter road crash fatalities reduced by 61%. This was further
demonstrated by an 80% reduction in Easter fatalities in April due to limited
movements and no social gatherings; however, key patterns indicated the abuse

of the emptier space on the road which is linked to road user behaviour.

The country continues to battle with drink driving and the lockdown months
provided a limited impact review of alcohol not only on South African roads but
as well as the medical fraternity. The bill to propose zero alcohol limits is

currently in Parliament, with comments from the public being accepted.

Majority of the Road Safety programmes were halted in a number of provinces
between April and December 2020 - due to restrictions in travel and
interpersonal engagement. This extended to non-achievement of provincial KPIs
linked to the transportation of school-going children and additional restrictions
when the Department of Education implemented a risk-adjusted strategy for
Grades 7 and 12.

Whilst the Corporation, DOT SOEs and provincial Road Safety Education units
adopted the use of technology to drive road safety messages; however, the key

focus during the quarter was on COVID-19. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 31 December 2020 1

--- Page 9 ---
this mode of engagement is limited in a country which is a hybrid of the First
and Third world.

The implementation of the National Road Safety Strategy remains a priority in
the country; however, the key challenge is the adoption of a Safe Systems
approach. Key challenges are inherently tough to change in South Africa an
amongst these, are the rise of information settlements next to major freeways,
poor town planning which does not prioritise non-motorised transport and
limited action towards safer vehicles in South Africa. The 2019 AA Vehicle Safety
Report provides an indication of poor consumer knowledge on vehicle safety
matters and a proactive interest ‘sporty’ aspect of a vehicle during purchase and

not safety.

Pedestrians remain the most vulnerable road user on South African roads,
accounting for more than 35% of the fatalities. Whilst this figure is much higher
for Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and Western Cape - key efforts are required to (1)
educate the road user more intensively and (2) provide protection to these road
users through engineering infrastructure. This remains a challenge in a country
or province which still has to prioritise the elimination of gravel road in key parts

of the country. This does also provide an opportunity to build safer roads.

2 INTRODUCTION

This report aims to provide an overview of the state of road safety in South
Africa between January and December 2020. the Road Traffic Management
Corporation is mandated by the Road Traffic Management Corporation Act, No.

20 of 1999 to report on road crashes in South Africa.

Over the last five years, South Africa has seen a decline in the number of road
crash fatalities; however, the reduction has not been significant to meet the
2010 - 2020 Decade of Action goals nor has the rate of reduction indicated that
the 2016 - 2030 National Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) targets will be met.

2.1 NRSS TARGET

The NRSS 2016-2030 sets the target of reducing fatalities in the country by 50
% from 13,967 fatalities that was recorded in 2010 by 2030. The graph below
depicts an initial smaller annual target from 2017 to 2021 where after a larger
linear annual decrease is set until 2030 to allow for the implementation of initial
NRSS interventions. The actual recorded fatalities for 2018, 2019 and 2020 are
below the targets set respectively. Once traction is gathered with the
implementation of the initial NRSS interventions, the targets will be aligned to
the actual recorded fatalities and new target set for the remaining years; it is
envisaged that this will be done with the commencement of the 2021/22 financial

year.

So stated in the NRSS 2016-2030, a reduction in serious injuries of equal amount
would also be considered a strategic target, however current data limitations
make measuring this progress difficult. Improving and addressing information
shortcomings such as collecting data on road crash injuries has therefore also

been identified as a strategic theme of this strategy.

There are key focus areas that combined, will lead to the attainment of the target
and this report is structured to provide an update, challenges, and planned

interventions within that focus area.

2.2 METHODOLOGIES AND DATA LIMITATION

2.2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)

is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation with

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 31 December 2020 4

--- Page 12 ---
a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the Corporation

receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic
Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to compile a

report.

2.2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the

Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

2.2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical

report. There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

2.2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to collect

scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

2.3. ROAD TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT METHODOLOGIES
AND DATA LIMITATION

The Road Traffic Law Enforcement Unit is primarily responsible for the

harmonization and alignment of road traffic enforcement operations within the

three spheres of government. The data is collected through reporting templates

received from Provinces and consolidated to write a report.
2.3.1 Road Traffic Law Enforcement Data Flow

Provinces submit reports to the RTMC on monthly basis through the NREP/EMISA

forms. These forms are submitted to the Corporation by email.

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 31 December 2020 5

--- Page 13 ---
2.3.2 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical

report. There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

2.3.3 Limitations

The information contained in the report is based mainly on the road traffic law
enforcement performance from Provinces and Municipalities with disintegrated
systems, which results in delays when reports are submitted. The delays are in
most cases resulted by regions submitting reports late to Provincial Office for
consolidation. There is a need to develop an integrated system which will be
used by all data capturers from all authorities and Supervisors to authorise

reports before the RTMC can extract information.

3 ROAD SAFETY COLLECTION METHODOLOGY

3.1 BACKGROUND

In previous editions of the State of Road Safety reports, the RTMC focused on
the road crash information, with the key Road Safety initiatives, Road Traffic
Law Enforcement interventions and progress on the implementation of the NRSS
not being consolidated into a single report. This led to limited engagements on
the overall interventions that the South African road safety stakeholders are

implementing, and alignment across all interventions.

Moreover, countries with similar road safety challenges have elevated the matter
of road safety and amongst others, these countries publish comprehensive
annual State of Road Safety reports with an objective to drive the road safety

agenda at the highest level possible.

However, key challenges remain a hindrance in the South African context
including:

e Limited data collection and information processing to understand macro and
micro societal factors affecting the set targets in road safety;

e The various platforms that exist in the fraternity, noting that multiple
stakeholders are interlinked with Road Safety in South Africa including and
not limited to the South Africa Police Service, provincial and_ local
government, non-governmental agencies and the private sector - each
pursuing its priority activities aligned to their mandate;

e The inherent corruption associated with the road traffic fraternity, which
extends from the acquisition of a driver’s license to road traffic law
transgressions and limited implications thereafter;

e Road user behaviour remains a challenge in the country including:

o Driving at an inappropriately high speeds in certain sections of the road;
o Driving under the influence of alcohol; and

o Distracted driving notably, the use of a mobile phone whilst driving.

4 STRUCTURE AND CULTURE

4.1 CHARACTERISTICS

South Africa, the southernmost country on the African continent, renowned for
its varied topography, great natural beauty, and cultural diversity, all of which
have made the country a favoured destination for travellers since the dawn of
democracy in 1994. The vast majority of black South Africans were not
enfranchised until 1994.

Africa is a developing country and ranks 113th on the Human Development
Index, the seventh highest in Africa. It has been classified by the World Bank as
a newly industrialized country, with the second-largest_economy in Africa, and
the 33rd-largest in the world. South Africa also has the most UNESCO World
Heritage Sites in Africa. The country is a middle power in international affairs; it

maintains significant regional influence and is a member of the G20.

Today South Africa enjoys a relatively stable mixed economy that draws on its
fertile agricultural lands, abundant mineral resources, tourist attractions, and
highly evolved intellectual capital. Greater political equality and economic
stability, however, do not necessarily mean social tranquillity. South African
society at the start of the 21st century continued to face steep challenges: rising
crime rates, ethnic tensions, great disparities in housing and educational

opportunities, and the AIDS pandemic.

South Africa is bordered by Namibia to the northwest, by Botswana and
Zimbabwe to the north, and by Mozambique and Swaziland to the northeast and
east. Lesotho, an independent country, is an enclave in the eastern part of the
republic, surrounded by South African territory. South Africa’s coastlines border

the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest.

4.2. POPULATION

According to Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), the midyear population of South
Africa has increased to an estimated 59,62 million in 2020. The population of
Gauteng is approximately 15,5 million (26,0%), the province with the highest
portion of the county’s population. KwaZulu-Natal follows with the second
highest portion of the population with 11,5 million people with the Northern Cape
province having the smallest portion of the population at only 1,29 million. Stats
SA further estimates that the female population is an estimated 30,5 million

females (51,1%) of the total population.

In addition, about 28,6% of the population is aged younger than 15 years and
approximately 9,1% (5,4 million) is 60 years or older. Of those younger than 15
years of age, the majority reside in KwaZulu-Natal (21,8%) and Gauteng
(21,4%). Of the elderly (those aged 60 years and older), the highest percentage
24,1% (1,31 million) reside in Gauteng. The proportion of elderly persons aged
60 and has grown from 7,6% in 2002 to 9,1% in 2020 (Stats SA, Mid-Year 2020
Report).

4.3. CLIMATE

South Africa’s long coastline - some 2,800 kilometres — influences much of the
climate. On the west coast is the cold Atlantic Ocean, and the warmer Indian
Ocean on the south and east. Starting at the hot and arid desert border with
Namibia in the northwest, South Africa’s coastline runs south down the cold
Skeleton Coast, around the Cape Peninsula to Cape Agulhas. This is the
southernmost tip of Africa, said to be where the Atlantic and Indian oceans meet.
In fact, it is here, slightly offshore, that two coastal currents meet, currents that
determine the different coastal climates. The cold Benguela current sweeps the

west coast, and the warm Agulhas current the east.

Figure 3: South African climate

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 31 December 2020 10

--- Page 18 ---
From Cape Agulhas the coastline moves east and slowly northwards, and the

climate becomes warmer and wetter. The Western Cape’s pretty green Garden
Route gives way to the forested Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape, and then humid
subtropical KwaZulu-Natal coast, famous for its beaches. In the northeast, the

coast reaches the border of Mozambique.

Running along most of the coast is a narrow low-lying strip of land, which soon
gives way to a higher plateau - the Great Escarpment. The high altitude of South
Africa’s interior means the country is generally much cooler than southern

hemisphere countries at the same latitude, such as Australia.

4.4 ROAD NETWORK

The South African Road Network consists of approximately 750,000 km of road
and is estimated to be the tenth largest road network in the world. The following
table illustrates the breakdown of the road network of road authorities within

the country.

4.6 STRUCTURE OF ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT

The National Department of Transport is responsible for the policy and legislation
governing roads and public transport. This is implemented through provincial
departments, local government and public entities. In terms of Schedule 5 of
the Constitution, provincial roads and traffic are an exclusive provincial function,
while municipal roads, traffic and parking are exclusive Schedule 5B municipal
functions. Public transport is a concurrent Schedule 4A function of both national
and provincial government. While municipal public transport is a Schedule 4B

concurrent municipal function.

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 31 December 2020 14

--- Page 22 ---
The strategy of the DoT has been guided by five strategic priorities that define
the work of the Department and the political agenda over the term of this
administration. The following key five (5) priorities have been identified which

will guide the effort of the sector:
e Safety as an enabler of service delivery;

e Public transport that enables social emancipation and an economy

that works;

e Infrastructure build that stimulates economic growth and job

creation;
e Building a maritime nation, elevating the oceans economy; and

e Accelerating transformation towards greater economic participation

based road safety activity between April and June 2020 due to COVID-19

regulations and restrictions on extra curricula activities.

5.5 ROAD TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT DRIVER &
VEHICULAR ACTIVITIES

South Africa is facing a challenge of road users who are not complying with the
traffic laws. This non-compliance is the reason more and more crashes are
occurring on daily basis. In order to reduce crashes on our roads, visibility and
traffic monitoring become key to ensure compliance with traffic rules, leading to

Road Traffic Law Enforcement Agencies conducting operations in order to:
° ensure total compliance of all road users with all road traffic regulations;
° create a save road traffic environment for all road users;
° stabilise hazardous location throughout the country;
° ensure intelligence driven deployment;
° promote zonal policing in villages and towns.

A total of 17 663 roadblocks were conducted countrywide between January and
December 2020. During these roadblocks, 10 060 438 vehicles were stopped

and checked.

Speed and driving being under the influence of alcohol can result into road
crashes where people can sometimes loose lives and some sustain injuries which
might lead to permanent disability. Various operations were conducted aiming
at reducing the lawlessness on the road thereby ensuring arrests are effected
for road users who were transgressing the traffic laws. The said operations
resulted into 35 343 road users being arrested for offences highlighted on table

6 ROAD SAFETY RESEARCH

The RTMC, in collaboration with the SAMRC-UNISA Violence, Injury and Peace
Research Unit (VIPRU) has investigated the role of driver alcohol intoxication as
a risk factor for fatal road traffic crashes in the country for the period 2016-
2018. The research is based on the analysis of data collected by the RTMC and
included records of 13 074 fatal crashes with known driver risk factors and was
published by the RTMC in March 2020.

Extrapolating from RTMC data and other research nationally, driver alcohol
intoxication accounted for 27.1% of fatal crashes in the country where driver
error is the primary attribution; with an associated estimated cost of R 18.2

billion. This is considerably higher than current estimates.

Given evidence globally to indicate that driver error may be involved in over
90% of all fatal crashes, it is possible that driver alcohol intoxication is implicated

in at least one in four of all fatal crashes in the country, regardless of cause.

Reference:

Other research published in March 2020, in line with the Safe System Approach
towards providing more forgiving roads in the country are a literature review on
speed and speed limits in SA, as Phase A of the improved driver behaviour
project and research on the effect of outdoor advertising on road safety and a

draft safety engineering manual for outdoor advertising in South Africa.

PERFORMANCE ON NATIONAL ROAD SAFETY
STRATEGY

The implementation of the National Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) 2016-2030 is

driven by the 82 outlined initiatives. With each of these initiatives aligned to the

five pillars of the Decade of Action for Road Safety, they are led by various

agencies viz.

Pillar 1:

Pillar 2:
Pillar 3:

Pillar 4:

Pillar 5:

Road Safety Management - RTMC and the Department of
Transport (DOT)

Safer Roads - SANRAL and Provincial Authorities

Safer Vehicles - The Department of Trade and Industry (and
its agencies namely, the National Regulator for Compulsory
Specification (NRCS), South African Bureau of Standards
(SABS)

Safer Road User - RTMC and DOT SOEs with the Road Safety
mandate

Post Crash Care - Department of Health and the Road
Accident Fund (RAF)

This section aims to provide an update on the 82 initiatives outlined in the NRSS,

noting that; the finalisation of a coherent implementation plan and the cost of

implementing the NRSS is still outstanding. The approach to address this

shortcoming is addressed in Annexure A of this report.

7.5 PILLAR 5: POST-CRASH RESPONSE

In the event that Pillars 2 - 4 did not provide the adequate protection
required to prevent a road crash, pillar 5 focuses on preventing fatalities (by
saving injured lives) and to reduce to impact of serious injuries when a crash
has occurred. As such, the immediate response for medical assistance and
treatment thereafter is largely led by the Department of Health and much
later, by the Road Accident Fund (RAF). The key initiatives under the pillar
are:

e Increasing Effectiveness of First Responses Post A Road Crash

7.7 CHALLENGES TO DATE

Over the last two years, the Corporation has been reporting on NRSS based on

information published in the quarterly performance reports of the stakeholders.

Whilst this indicated that efforts made by various stakeholders to

implementation the initiatives, the overall conclusion was that:

e The efforts were not coordinated and provide the best chance of
success;

e There was a limited opportunity to fairly evaluate the impact if these
were not coordinated optimally; and

e There was a limited opportunity to solicit external funding if the costs

were unknown.

The work undertaken by the Corporation in 2017/18 began to pave uniformity
in the implementation of the NRSS; however, systematic constraints led to

disruptions in the process such as:

e The then strategic programmes were not amended to integrate
NRSS-linked initiatives, and this led to the NRSS being considered
to be additional work without additional funding in the current
MTEF budget cycle;

e Unsigned off performance achievements linked to the NRSS by Ac-
counting Officers were not auditable and thus systematically, they
were equivalent to additional voluntary performance information;

and

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 31 December 2020 37

--- Page 45 ---
e The above-mentioned challenge led to provinces reverting to Annual
Performance Plan targets (including transversal indicators) — which
were consolidated for the RTMC and the DOT. In certain cases,
NRSS-linked work was kept at an operational level which other

simply dropped it.

The above-mentioned challenges are; however, addressed in the revised

approach in the engagement of stakeholders.

8 EFFECT OF COVID-19 ON ROAD SAFETY

An analysis to evaluate the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown and the consequent
lockdown periods Levels show a correlation between the number of fatal crashes
in 2020 vs 2019 during the different levels of lockdown. Crash data illustrated
on the figure below depicts the number of fatal crashes on the same dates in
2020 vs 2019:

| a
oA illu ASAIN | mt

Figure 9: Effect of Covid-19 on fatal crashes during periods of lockdown

It is clear from the above graph, that the number of fatal crashes for the two
periods followed very much the same trend from 1 Jan with a drastic drop in
vehicle flow on 25 March 2020 when the Level-5 lockdown commenced. It could
be argued that less vehicles on the road contributed to less fatal crashes due to
less points of conflict due to amongst others less poor driving behaviour and less
pedestrian activity when the lockdown commenced.

It is unfortunate to note that with the gradual relaxation of the lockdown levels
from Level-5 to level-1, that the number of fatal crashes followed the same
upward trend with the increase of road user activity. Very much the same daily
numbers of fatal crashes were recorded between 2020 and 2019 towards the

end of Level-1.

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 31 December 2020 39

Relating the number of fatal crashes per month in 2019 to 2020 vs vehicle flow
was done on a rural perspective by calculating the monthly % change from 2019

to 2020 for both parameters and comparing such.

The figure below depicts the monthly % change between 2020 and 2019 in
vehicle flow on South Africa’s national road network vs the same for the number

of fatal crashes:

Figure 10: Monthly % change between 2020 and 2019 in vehicle flow on the national

Even though the overall monthly % change for fatal crashes is much higher (peak &
change: April = -77.4%) than for vehicle flow (peak & change: April = -15.1%) on the
national road network, a similar trend is evident for both parameters in that there is a
drastic relative decline in both with gradual normalisation towards small monthly change
for both.

9 ROAD SAFETY OUTCOMES

During the 2020 calendar year, 8 405 fatal crashes were reported, a reduction
in fatal crashes of 19.0% from 2019 when 10 381 fatal crashes were recorded.
The large reduction in fatal crashes is directly related to the Covid-19 restriction
of vehicle and people movement from 24 March 2020 to 31 December 2020.

vehicles showed a reduction of 20.24% from 10.90 for 2019 to 8.69 for 2020.

The distribution of fatalities per road user type during the period of analysis
followed the same trend as in 2019 without significant change. The 39,8%
pedestrian fatalities recorded for 2020 is slightly less than the recorded 40.5%
in 2019, notwithstanding that there was a reduction in fatalities of more than
20%. This trend in the percentage pedestrian deaths (WHO 2018) is very much

10 PEDESTRIAN SAFETY

10.1 PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES

Pedestrian safety remains the most significant road safety challenge in South
Africa with 39.8% of all fatalities recorded in 2020 and slightly lower than 40.5%
recorded in 2019. Pedestrian deaths are 21.6% lower than the same recorded
for 2019 due to the restriction of people and vehicle movement from March 2020
to December 2020. Notwithstanding the large decrease in pedestrian deaths in
from 2019 to 2020 the percentage of pedestrian deaths remains almost the

same.

Figure 21: % Pedestrian fatal crashes of all fatal crashes per province

From the figure above, the most pedestrian fatal crashes, or crashes where one
more pedestrian were killed in a fatal crash of total fatal crashes in the respective
province, were reported in the KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and Western Cape
provinces with more than 50% of the respective fatal crashes involving
pedestrian deaths, the same trend as in 2019. Nationally, in 46.1% of all crashes
where reported, one or more pedestrian was killed. This means that in almost

half of fatal crashes recorded in the country, one or more pedestrian is killed.

The table below depicts the pedestrian deaths per province during the period
analysed. In line with the recorded fatal pedestrian crashes above, Gauteng,
KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape provinces have the highest pedestrian
deaths with more than 50% recorded in the three provinces. The province with

the lowest percentage of pedestrian deaths is Free State.

Similar to the country profile for age of road crash deaths, most pedestrians

killed in road crashes are between the age of 25 and 39 with 34,4% of all

pedestrians killed within this age group. Alarming however is that a 5th (20.5%)

of all pedestrian killed are children up to 14 years of age.

The schools closed from the 18 of March 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
The number of crashes and fatalities reduced from April due to travel restrictions.
Schools re-opened on the 1° of June and re-closed again on the 27" of July due
to the increase in number of COVID-19 infections and crashes also decreased in
July. After July, there was an increase for both crashes and fatalities right up to
December 2020.

Figure 29: Pedestrian fatalities per day of the week

Further analysis of the time and day of pedestrian fatal crashes are depicted in the table
below. The top 10% time-bins in which pedestrian fatal crashes occur per day of week
are indicated from white fill (no pedestrian fatal crashes) to dark red fill where the
highest percentage of all fatal pedestrian crashes occurred during the analysis period.

Within the top 10%, a singular spike occurred on Sundays from 00:00-01:00 with the
rest occurring mostly between 17:00- 23:00 on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday’s. The
percentages per time bin for all crashes where pedestrians were killed (far-right column
in the table below) indicates that almost a 5‘" or 19.68% of all pedestrian fatal crashes
occurred between 18:00 and 20:00.

The percentage pedestrian fatal crashes per day of week indicates that most pedestrian

crashes occurred on Saturdays with 21,0% followed by Sundays with 17,6%. In 2020,

11 COST OF CRASHES

The high number of road traffic crashes and their associated consequences has a
significant impact on South African society, which in turn continues to hamper socio-
economic development and affects the well-being of all South Africans. This impact is
measured in terms of human lives lost, “pain, grief and suffering”, as well as an
increasing cost to the economy. Indicated in the figure below, the 2020 cost of road
crashes is an estimated R142.6 billion; adjusted with CPI and crash statistics from the
calculated R142.95 billion for 2015 - Published September 2016 (link below). The
estimated cost of crashes showed a huge decrease of R28.01 billion or 16.42% from
2019 to 2020 which will be due to the Covid-19 related restrictions in 2020.
