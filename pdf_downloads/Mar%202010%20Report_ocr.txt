Based on the 2006 Millennium Development Goals,
Traffic Safety Management Plan is to reduce by hal

Road Traffic Report — Year 2009/10

to Reduce Fatalities by 50%

one of the goals of the 2015 Road
the rate of accident fatalities arising

from road and other transport by 2015. In the development of the 2015 Plan it was agreed
that the number of fatalities for the year 2007 would be used as the benchmark on which
the 50% reduction would be based. Using this benchmark and the 50% target reduction,
the maximum allowable number of road fatalities per quarter per province up to the end of
2015 was calculated as continuous reduced target figures over the 8 year period. These
set targets for the indicated quarters for each province and the RSA total, are shown in the

table below, shown as “Target” figures or maximum al

lowable number of fatalities.

The information in the table and graph above shows that better performing
provinces (Differences less than”0”) well on track towards achieving the goal of
reducing road fatalities by 50% by the year 2015, amongst others are :
¢ Gauteng : which is also continuously improving its performance from
-17,07% in March 2009 to -14,10% in March 2010;
e Western Cape : shows an improvement performance from -2.95% in
March 2009 to -7.96% in March 2010.
e Free State : shows an improved performance from -16.48% in March
2009 to -1.74% in December 2009. Even though for the last quarter the
difference percentage was above 10%.
e Northern Cape : shows an improvement from -9.85% in March 2009 to -
8.93% in September 2009.

The provinces that are not performing as required,(Differences larger than “O”) are
the following:

e KwaZulu-Natal : overall the worst performing province, with even a
continuous increase in the quarterly number of road fatalities that
exceed the set quarterly targets for the province — ranging from +21,40%
in March 2009; +29,29% in June 2009 and +32,47% in September 2009,
31,37% in December 2009 and lastly +31.00% in March 2010. This

province was the biggest contributor to the RSA, on a national basis not
achieving its set target towards the end of the review period.

e Limpopo : made no contribution towards achieving the 2015 goals. Over
the review period the performance of this province worsened from
+5,71% in March 2009 to +31,43% in March 2010.

e Mpumalanga: made no contribution towards achieving the 2015 goals.
Over the review period the performance of this province worsened from
+11,49% in March 2009 to +7,66% in March 2010.

Gauteng and Western Cape were operating close to the border-line with
figures ranging from -7,96% to -14.10% in March 2010 moving in a non-
contributory direction.

National - RSA : over the review period the national figures range from
-0,54% in March 2009 to +8,14% in March 2010. A better performance can
only be observed for March 2009.The country’s performance towards the
reduction of fatalities by 50% for the assessed period is deteriorating. The
worst performing provinces listed above, contributed to this non-achieving
trend, with the biggest negative influence from KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo.

Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — Year 2009/10

7. Results of the 2009 Road Traffic Offence Survey

7.1 Introduction

The Arrive Alive Offence Monitoring Program is part of the comprehensive Arrive Alive
road traffic safety program which was launched by the Department of Transport on 1
October 1997. The main goal of the Arrive Alive program is to promote road traffic safety
throughout South Africa. The purpose is to reduce road accidents, fatalities and injuries. A
comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach is followed in the Arrive Alive program. One of
the methods to reduce accidents, fatalities and injuries is to reduce road traffic offence
levels through law enforcement and education interventions. The goal of the Arrive Alive
Offence Monitoring Program is to provide the RTMC with management information related
to the effectiveness of law enforcement and education intervention in the country. The
information obtained from the monitoring program is mainly used for the following
purposes:

a. To complement existing traffic safety information and to clarify the factors that
contributes to road accidents;
To measure the effect and impact of road safety and law enforcement programs
To determine the general level of lawlessness on the road network on a year to
year basis.

7.2. Combined national offence index

7.2.1. The use of indicators and indexes

An explanation of the concepts of indicators and indexes is provided in Annexure A
attached to the detail report. Readers who are not familiar with these concepts should read
this annexure before reading the rest of this summary.

7.2.2. Standards that were applied

The value (“size”) of the standards for the different offences is debatable. Whatever the
considerations, it is important that offence levels should be really low: Standards for the
evaluation of the success of law compliance programs should therefore be strict. The

following standards have been applied in this document after consultation with the RTMC:

& Exceeding the speed limit: Maximum 5% defective rate (i.e. not more than 5%
offenders)

53

--- Page 54 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — Year 2009/10

= Exceeding the legal breath alcohol limit: Maximum of 0.4% defective rate at any
time of the day of night (i.e. not more than 1 offender in 250 drivers tested found
over the legal limit)
Crossing on a barrier line: Maximum of 1% barrier line offences (1 offence for every
100 convoys observed)
Vehicles disobeying traffic signals: Maximum of 1% of red phases with an offence
Wearing of seat belt: Maximum 15% offence rate

The use of child restraints: Maximum 15% offence rate

Driver licence present and valid: Maximum 1% offence rate

The validity of the vehicle registration discs and correlation between the registration
disc and number plate: Maximum 1% offence rate

Public Driver Permit present and valid: Maximum 1% offence rate

Worn vehicle tyres: Maximum 1% defective rate

Vehicle lights defective: Maximum 1% defective rate

The use of cellular phones while driving a vehicle: Maximum 1% offence rate
Pedestrians disobeying traffic signals: Maximum of 1% of red phases with an
offence

#

eR REE

fREREE

The indexes in the following sections have been formulated in such a way that all these
standards are expressed as 1 (one) index unit. This means that when any of these
standards have been reached, the index number of that offence will be equal to 1. For
example: An index number of 1 for alcohol offences would mean that an offence rate of
0.4% was observed during the survey (this is exactly on the standard rate of 0.04%). An
index number of 0.5 for seat belts would mean that an offence rate of 7.5% was observed
during the survey (this is 0.5 times the standard rate of 15%). An index number of 2.0 for
speeding offences would mean that an offence rate of 10% was observed during the
survey (this is 2 times the standard rate of 5%).

The reason for the development of these indexes is that it allows for comparison of the
different types of offences on an equal basis. Without indexes it would be difficult to
compare an offence which is measured in terms of, for example, “milligrams per litre”
(alcohol) with an offence which is expressed in terms of “kilometres per hour” (speed) or
“percentage of red phases with offence” (Disobeying traffic signals). By reducing all these
offences to index numbers which relate the offence levels to their respective targets, the
rates of the different offences become mutually comparable and can also be used to
calculate combined (or joint) indexes for the different offences.

7.3. OVERVIEW: the state of law compliance on the road

Examination of the results of the 2009 survey indicated several major improvements.
There were, however, also movements in the opposite direction. In general it must be
stated that there is still reason for serious concern about the traffic offence levels in the
country. The following sections discuss some of the main indicators which reflect the
current situation on our roads.

7.4. Speed Offences

Speed offence levels for 2009 still remain very high. Figures show that night time offence
rates are on average higher than those of day time. For urban speed zones, the overall
offence index has decreased from 6.7 to 6.3. For rural speed zones, the overall offence
index has increased from 5.8 to 7.9. These figures are still very high and very far from
reaching the desired maximum offence rate of 5%.

The following sections show the Urban Day, Urban Night, Rural Day, Rural Night,
Weekday and Weekend speed offence rates applying to each of the vehicle types.
Additional graphs also show the relationship between the different sub categories,
including Urban Day versus Urban Night, Rural Day versus Rural Night, and Weekday
versus weekend.

The information above shows that on a national basis the index for rural offences has
increased from 5.7 in 2008 to 7.9 in 2009. The province with the largest increase is Kwa-
Zulu Natal, where the offence index increased from 5.8 to 10.5, followed by Eastern Cape
where the offence index increased from 5.2 to 9.5. Kwa-Zulu Natal is also the province
with the highest offence index in this regard for 2009, with 10.5, followed by Eastern Cape
with 9.5. Northern Cape shows the largest decrease in its offence index from 7.8 to 6.4,
followed by Western Cape from 7.5 to 6.5.

7.5. Alcohol Offences

Both day time and night time national offence indices are higher than the desired standard.
The day time national offence index has decreased from 2.41 to 1.27. The night time
national offence index has decreased from 3.57 to 2.38.

The following sections show the Day and Night offence rates and their indices applying to
each of the vehicle types. Additional graphs also show the relationship between the
different sub categories, including Day versus Night, and Weekday versus Weekend. As
with previous reports, there is no differentiation between Urban and Rural because there is
no prescribed sample size for this category.

On average the night time offence levels are higher than the day time offence level, which
gives a clear indication that drivers are more likely to be under the influence of alcohol at
night than during the day. Both the day and night time offence rates are higher than the
desired maximum of 0.4%, once again raising some serious concerns, given the major
contribution that driving under the influence of alcohol has towards road accidents and
fatalities. When looking at the overall trend line since the start of the 2002 offence survey,
it is clear to see a definitive decline in the overall alcohol offence rate.

The information above shows that on a national basis the index for night time alcohol
offences has decreased from 3.57 in 2008 to 2.38 in 2009. The province with the largest

increase is Free State, where the offence index increased from 0.86 to 4.46, followed by
Limpopo where the offence index increased from 0.00 to 3.13. The Free State is the
province with the highest offence index in this regard for 2009, with 4.46 followed by
Mpumalanga. All provinces, except the Free State, Mpumalanga and Limpopo, showed
decreases in offence indices between 2008 and 2009.

7.6. Urban Pedestrian Compliance

Road accidents involving pedestrians is the biggest contributor to fatalities on our roads.
Approximately 40% of fatal accidents involve pedestrians. It is therefore important to

59


--- Page 60 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — Year 2009/10

obtain an indication of the extent of unlawful (which is per definition unsafe) or informal
(i.e. uncontrolled) crossing of pedestrians or presence of pedestrians on roads.

During previous studies, unlawful presence of pedestrians was determined by observing
pedestrian “jay-walking” in urban areas. Due to the subjective nature of this type of survey,
the survey was changed in 2008 to rather look at the compliance of pedestrians with
pedestrian signals at controlled intersections (robots).

Informal or uncontrolled presence of pedestrians on roads is measured by observing the
number of pedestrians on or alongside high speed rural roads. The following tables refer to
the first of these, namely pedestrian compliance at traffic signals.

The following section shows the offence figures for urban pedestrian compliance with
traffic signals. The graphs are broken down into Urban Day, Urban Night, and Urban Day
versus Urban Night offences.

Both the urban day and the urban night categories show extremely high offence rates. This
is a matter of serious concern, given the large contribution that pedestrians make towards
roads fatalities. This is a clear indication that pedestrians are completely disregarding the
road laws set out to govern their movements.

The information above shows that on a national basis the percentage pedestrians that
ignore traffic signals during the night time increased from 88.1% in 2008 to 90.1% in 2009.
The province with the largest increase is Kwa-Zulu Natal where the offence rate increased

Limpopo and the Free State all show a decrease in offence rate percentage.

7.7. Unobserved Seatbelts

The following section shows the offence figures for Unobserved Seatbelts for light motor
vehicles.

Previous surveys looked at the wearing of seatbelts recorded at road blocks. The data
gathered for seatbelt wearing at road blocks are however not reliable, as most vehicle
occupants that are not wearing seatbelts, will immediately put on a seatbelt when
approaching a roadblock. This information can clearly be seen in the 2007 report, where
only 7% of drivers observed at roadblocks do not wear seat belts. During a survey done at
robots, where the driver and passenger are not aware that they are being checked for
seatbelt wearing, this percentage increases drastically to more than 50%.

For the reasons above, the wearing of seatbelts for the front driver and front passenger
were not recorded at roadblocks for the 2009 survey. Instead the focus for the 2009, and
future surveys, would be for the unobserved recording of seatbelt wearing data.

On average, the front passenger offence rates are higher than the front driver offence
rates, indicating that the front passenger is much less likely to wear a seatbelt than the
driver of the vehicle. Even so, the national offence rate for both these categories is more
than 4 times larger than the desired maximum, indicating a serious disregard towards the
wearing of seatbelts among drivers and front passengers.

decreased from 4.7 in 2008 to 4.5 in 2009. The province with the largest increase is
Limpopo, where the offence index increased from 5.0 to 5.3, followed by the North West
where the offence index increased from 4.8 to 5.0. Limpopo is also the province with the
highest offence index in this regard for 2009, with 5.3, followed by the North West. Kwa-

Cape all showed decreases in offence indices between 2008 and 2009.

7.8. Red Traffic Signals

The following tables show the figures for Urban Traffic Signal offences. The sections are
broken down into Urban Day, Urban Night, and Urban Day versus Urban Night.

Also note that data is shown in two different ways. The first part contained in section 2.9.1
shows the Average offences per phase, while the second part contained in section 2.9.2
shows the Average phases with offences. This is done in order to adhere to previous
report formats.

When considering the Average offences per phase, the day time offence rates are on
average a little higher than night time offence rates. All provinces, except for Mpumalanga,
North West, and Limpopo, showed a decrease in offence rates for both day and night time
categories.

When looking at the overall trend line, it is clear to see that since the 2002 survey, there is
a slight decrease in the day time offence rates. The opposite is true for the night time
offence rates.

--- Page 65 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — Year 2009/10

When considering the Average phases with offences, the national day and night time
offence rates are 24.7% and 19.6% respectively.

With such a low offence rate per phase, and such a high percentage of phases with
offences, it is clear to see that with a lot of opportunity to offend; only a few people would
grab the opportunity and commit a traffic signal offence.

7.9. Overtaking on Barrier Lines

Previous barrier line surveys reported on the average number of vehicles overtaking on a
barrier line per 2 minute interval. The data presented with this type of analysis varied
greatly from year to year, due to the random nature of the event. Despite various
measures that were implemented to try and improve the data accuracy, no reliable trends
could be determined for barrier line offences.

The 2008 and 2009 collection of barrier line offence data was changed to record the
number of convoys of vehicles passing, and report on the number of convoys where
barrier line offences were present. This percentage of convoys with offences was used as
the offence rate. This type of analysis yielded results that were more in line between
provinces, and should provide better statistics for multi year comparisons.

The following tables show figures for Barrier Line Offences. The tables are broken down
into Day and Night categories. A graph showing the relationship between the Day and
Night offence rates follows thereafter.

On average, the day time national offence rate is slightly higher than the night time
national offence rate. This is a clear indication that drivers are much more cautious during
the night than during the day time, resulting from the reduced visibility. Both category
offence rates are much higher than the desired maximum.

This high disregard for barrier lines can most likely be attributed to drivers preferring to
trust their own instincts when overtaking another vehicle, rather than obeying the barrier
line as a means of safe overtaking.

or all vehicles has decreased from 3.9 in 2008 to 1.5 in 2009. All provinces show a
decrease in their offence indices between the 2008 and 2009. Western Cape shows the
largest decrease in its offence index from 7.6 to 1.6. Gauteng has the highest offence
index for this category with 2.0, followed by the Eastern Cape with 1.8.

7.11. Absence of Professional Drivers Permit

The following tables show the figures for PrDP offences per vehicle type. Note that PrDP
offences are only applicable on Minibus Taxis, Trucks, and Buses.

When comparing the 2008 and 2009 results, it is clear to see a slight decrease in the
overall offence rate. This is off course an indication that more and more people are indeed
carrying a valid PrDP while driving, and that more and more people are presenting a valid
PrDP when requested to.

Looking at the overall trend since the 2002 survey, it is easy to see a major improvement
regarding this offence category, with the national offence rate decreasing from 19.8% to
the current 2.0% offence rate for Minibus Taxis, Trucks, and Buses combined.

The overall offence rate for 2009 is still twice as high as the desired maximum offence rate
of 1%.

Information on absent professional driving permits (PrDPs) for trucks, buses, and minibus

taxis combined, in both urban and rural areas, during daytime and night time is shown in
the following table and reflected in the graph below.

The following tables show the Worn Tyre Offence rates applying to the different vehicle
types. Surveys were done during roadblocks.

When comparing the 2008 and 2009 offence data, the 2008 offence rates are on average
slightly lower than the 2008 offence rates.

When looking at the overall trend line since the 2002 offence survey, it is clear to see a
steady decline in the national offence rates, indicating some improvement.

Yet the average national offence rate for 2009 is 5.8 times higher than the desired
maximum offence rate for this category, which should raise some serious concerns, given
the large contribution that worn tyres has regarding road accidents.

The following tables show the offence rates for Vehicle Lights. The sections are sub
divided into vehicle type.

When comparing the 2007 and the 2008 offence survey data, it is clear to see that the
offence rates for all vehicle types has decreased, indicating that less vehicles have

damaged lights.

When looking at the individual light categories, it is clear to see that the brake light
category has the highest offence rate, followed by head lights and tail light respectively.

When looking at the different vehicle categories, it is clear to see that the highest offence
rate was recorded among Minibus Taxis and Trucks, followed by Light motor vehicles, and

Buses respectively.

The national offence rate for all three categories discussed in this section is still much
higher than the desired maximum.

On average there is a slight decrease between the 2008 and 2007 offence rates. When
looking at the overall trend line since the 2003 offence survey and ignoring the
exceptionally low offence rates for the 2009 survey, there seems to be a slight increase in

8. Conclusion

The road traffic offence survey results shows that the level of lawlessness
is improving slightly compared to the previous year.

The information contained in this report clearly indicates an increase in
the national number of fatal crashes and fatalities. However, 76% of male
fatalities were recorded and most fatalities were recorded between 20 —
39 age groups. Most crashes still occur over the weekend. The number of
fatalities for pedestrians has decreased, and increased for drivers and
passengers.

Law enforcement, education and communication should be conducted in
line with the areas of concern as stipulated in the report to reduce the
number of crashes and fatalities in the country.

The recommendations flowing from the 2009 offence monitoring
study are as follows:

a. Although the general trend of law compliance rates has decreased
between 2008 and 2009, the study found that, as in the past, offence
levels on South African roads and the related levels of risk are still
extremely high. The recommendation is repeated that a renewed,
innovative, systematic, coordinated law enforcement and education
intervention strategy be introduced under the leadership of the
national Minister of Transport and the Road Traffic Management
Corporation to bring the situation under control. This should be done
in cooperation with the provincial and local spheres of government,
other relevant departments of state, the passenger and freight
transport industries, and research institutions. The aim should be to
identify the factors that will bring about change in road user behaviour;
and by focussing on those factors, to achieve levels of traffic law
compliance that will make a real difference to the traffic safety
situation. The implementation of AARTO should be monitored
carefully and the data recorded compared to national and local
offence levels to determine the effectiveness of the system.

b. The most important offences to focus on, as identified in the study,
are:

83

--- Page 84 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — Year 2009/10

= Driving under the influence of Alcohol: Very high levels of
drunk driving were encountered in some provinces, especially
during the night, with a national night time offence index of 2.4.
Alcohol control should be stepped up and the penalties should
be severe.

™ Barrier line offences. The huge contribution of this offence to
the dangerous situation on our roads should be recognised,
with a national day time offence index of 16.1.

™& Smooth and damaged tyres. Serious problems with tyres of
vehicles, including trucks and taxis were found on the road,
with a national worn tyre index of 6.8. Reasons for serious
deterioration of tyres and for the apparent neglect of tyres by a
large proportion of vehicle owners, professional drivers and the
freight and passenger transport industries should be
investigated.

Speeding. High levels of speeding offences were observed.
The national rural speed index increased from 5.8 in 2008 to
7.9 in 2009. Speed discipline must be restored on South
African roads and community leaders on all levels should set
an example.

c. The recommendation with regard to pedestrian safety that was
already made in the 2003 offence monitoring report is repeated.
Pedestrian accidents are the single biggest accident category in
South Africa. Pedestrians must be protected effectively in all parts of
the traffic network. International research has demonstrated that
highly reduced speed levels in urban areas (pedestrian sensitive
areas) are the most effective and affordable way to reduce pedestrian
casualties. There is a disproportionate relationship between
vehicle speed in pedesirian sensitive areas and the number of
pedestrians injured and killed. Compared to countries where
international best practice in pedestrian safety is applied, the South
African urban speed limit of 60km per hour is already high. Add to this
that as many as 35% of urban drivers exceed this relatively high
speed limit and one of the main reasons for the disastrous level of
pedestrian casualties in this country becomes evident.

84

--- Page 85 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report —- Year 2009/10

d. Reduced speed levels via reduced speed limits combined with
vigorous speed control measures in pedestrian sensitive areas
should be a top priority, and will make a significant contribution
to the reduction of pedestrian casualties in the country.
