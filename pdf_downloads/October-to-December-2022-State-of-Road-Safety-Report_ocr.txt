1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms and provincial
inputs; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced

vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report provides fatal road crash statistics in South African public roads.
The performance is for the period October to December 2022. The

performance per each focus areas have been provided below.
Road Crashes Data

A total of 3 211 fatalities were recorded between October and December 2022
compared to 3 637 for the same period in 2021. For the same period 2 684
fatal crashes were recorded compared to 3 000 period in 2021. This is a

reduction of 11.7% for fatalities and 10.5% fatal crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

Number of registered vehicles decreased by 7,222 (0.06%) from 12,957,208 in
December 2021 to 12,964,430 vehicles in December 2022.

Number of learner driving licences issued increased by 8,079 (25.74%) from 1
081,615 in December 2021 to 1,089,694 in December 2022.

Number of driving licences issued increased by 481 231 (3.34%) from
14,416,294 in December 2021 to 14,897,525 in December 2022.

SECTION A
. INTRODUCTION

This report compares fatal crashes reported to police stations between October
and December 2021 and October and December 2022 using the CHoCOR
Forms and information recorded by provinces. The report includes information
on registered vehicles, driving licences and professional driving permits issued
from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS); and information on
population growth using the 2021 mid-year population estimates from
Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
and Provincial Departments of Road and Transport are the sources of fatal
crash data. SAPS provides the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC)
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (called the CAS list) and further to this
the RTMC receives CHoCOR forms from various police stations; the provincial
departments also submit data on fatal crashes to RTMC. RTMC validates all
inputs for consistency, captures, processes, and verifies the data and compiles

the report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms and provincial inputs. The data is
then submitted to RTMC.

--- Page 10 ---
7

2.3. Data processing

The data is received from the three areas (SAPS, CHoCOR and provinces),
validated, captured, processed, and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with SAPS

and provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for collection of all road crashes, traffic
volumes, road conditions, weather reports amongst others to complement the

data currently collected.

2.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms and

provincial inputs are used by RTMC record fatality data on daily basis.

3. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers fatal road crash data. The section encompasses the number
of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality data per road user
group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between the third quarter of the
financial year 2021/22 and third quarter of the financial year 2022/23.
Nationally there has been a decrease of 316 (10.5%) fatal crashes. At a
provincial level all provinces recorded a decrease. In terms of decrease in
number of fatal crashes the highest decreases were in Kwa-Zulu Natal at (110)
followed by Gauteng at (74). The highest percentage (%) decreases were in
North West at (24.0%) and Kwa-Zulu Natal at (18.2%).

issues around mechanical failures); and environment factors (include limited
visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road

infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road and weather conditions).

Human factors contribute a high percent to fatal crashes. These factors
contributed 86.6% to fatal crashes during the period under review, these

factors remain a big concern.
