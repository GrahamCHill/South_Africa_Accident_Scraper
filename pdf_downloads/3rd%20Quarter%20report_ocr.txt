Major Accidents Investigated

The Corporation set the criteria to investigate major crashes as follows:

= Crashes where five (5) or more people died,

= Crashes where there are four (4) or more vehicles involved with a fatality,
= Dangerous Goods crashes with a fatality and

= Any crash that the Corporation deems necessary to investigate

9.1 Major crashes for the 3" quarter 2015/2016 financial year
A total number of thirty-seven (37) major crashes were reported and investigated for the

period under review. Two-hundred and seven (207) people were killed and two-hundred
and one (201) people sustained injuries as a result of these major crashes.

10. Road Safety Interventions

During the months of October to December which falls within Quarter 3, road safety
programmes based on the Key Performance Indicators as indicated in the Annual
Performance Plan 2016/2017 were executed. Programmes on all four road user groups were

done as well as community based programmes.

The National Road Safety Strategy has been developed and awaiting Cabinet approval.

The Evaluation report on Transversal Indicators for Quarter 3 is being compiled. The
evaluation is also dependent on the finalized third quarter Road Traffic Report as it is an
outcomes impact evaluation of the road safety transversal indicators.

During this quarter under review 9 Institutions of Higher Learning were visited and road
safety presentations were done. The target audience was the youth with the aim to expose

them to road safety education.

The Youth Safety Driver programme was done in provinces.
Programmes on the following were done in provinces:

* Activities on the pedestrian programme
* Activities on the passenger programme
* Activities on the driver programme
* Activities on the cyclist programme

As part of the community based programmes the stray animal programme was done in the
following provinces:

North West,

Kuruman, Northern Cape,

Bloemfontein Phase six in Free State.

One interfaith outreach was done.

All the programmes executed aimed to have an impactful result of creating road safety
awareness and a safer road conduct.
