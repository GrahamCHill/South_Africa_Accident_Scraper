1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT
This report is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms; and

¢ To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced
vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide the road crash statistics for the period
October to December 2018. The performance is as provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 3 211 fatalities were recorded for the period between
October - December 2018 from 2 575 fatal crashes. As a result, there was a
decrease of 15.1% fatalities from 2017 to 2018. The most affected road user
group during 2018 remains to be the pedestrian. However, passengers
recorded a slight increase of 1.3% from 33.9% to 35.2%.

A total number of forty-one (41) major crashes were reported and investigated
for the period under review. Two-hundred and ninety-eight (298) persons were
killed and two-hundred and seventy (270) persons sustained injuries in these
major crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 257 867 (2.11%) from
12 205 112 on 31 December 2017 to 12 462 979 vehicles on 31 December
2018.

--- Page 10 ---
On a national! basis the total number of vehicles that are either un-roadworthy,
un-licenced or both increased by 105 543 (9.91%) from 1 064 623 vehicles as
on 31 December 2017 to 1 170 166 vehicles as on 31 December 2018.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 41 916 (3.45%)
from 1213 704 on 31 December 2017 to 1 171 788 on 31 December 2018.
The number of driving licences issued increased by 397 182 (3.14%) from

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between October and December 2017 and 2018 using the
CHoCOR Form. In addition, the report includes information about registered
vehicles, un-roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and
professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic Information
System (NaTIS), Law Enforcement and Road Safety information. Furthermore,
it includes information about population growth using the 2018 mid-year
population estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to
compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the
Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

--- Page 12 ---
. faffic

2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical
report. There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation

purpose.
2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to
collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which encompasses the
number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality information per

road user group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. There was a decrease
of 515 (16.7%) in comparison to quarter 3 of 2017 and 2018. All provinces recorded
decreases in with the exception of Eastern Cape. The highest decrease was recorded
for Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and North West with 22.9%, 22.1% and 21.0%,
respectively. Gauteng and Western Cape followed with above 19% decreases.

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and LDV’s with contributions of 45.9% and 20.3% respectively during 2018.
The two vehicle types may contribute to high number of fatalities for
passengers.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows:
human factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that
are valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for October to December 2018 showed that human factors
contributed 90.2% to the occurrence of fatal crashes followed by roads and
environmental factors at 5.6%; and vehicle factors with a contribution of
4.2%.

as when a person or persons are killed during or immediately after a crash, or
death within 30 days after a crash happened as a direct result on such crash.
This section will encompass the number of fatalities and percentage
distribution per road user group, gender, race and per age.
