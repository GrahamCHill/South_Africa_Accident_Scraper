8. Results of the 2008 Road Traffic Offence Survey

8.1

Introduction

This part of the Road Traffic Report provides a summary of the results of the 2008
Road Traffic Offence Survey. Offence rates and trends serve as indicators of the
success of road safety promotion programmes and projects. By comparing the
rates on an annual basis, the long term progress with regard to traffic discipline,
law abidance and quality and safety in road traffic can be measured, monitored
and evaluated.

Traffic offence surveys are annually conducted with the view to:

determine the general level of lawlessness on the road network on a year to
year basis;

measure the effect and impact of road safety communication and law
enforcement programmes, projects and campaigns; and

complement existing traffic safety information as well as to clarify the
factors that contribute to road crashes.

Offence surveys are conducted on the most critical road traffic offences that
generally contribute to the occurrence of road crashes and/or the severity thereof;
and include the following:

Speed: in urban and rural areas (for grouped categories of vehicles);
Alcohol levels (only drivers);
Wearing rate of seatbelts — Surveyors were not observed by the drivers and
passengers of the vehicles (Unobserved drivers & front seat passengers);
Drivers of vehicles ignoring traffic signals;
Drivers of vehicles overtaking across barrier (no-overtaking) lines;
Pedestrian traffic signal compliance at intersections in urban areas;
Driver documentation:
° Carrying of driving licences;
° Carrying of professional driving permits (PrDPs);
Vehicle documentation; agreement between the license number on the
number plate of vehicles and the licence disc;
Vehicle fitness:
° Condition of tyres; worn and/or damaged; and
° Functioning of vehicle lights; front, tail and brake lights.

62

--- Page 63 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — March 2009

For the purpose of these surveys vehicles are grouped into the following 4
categories:

e Light motor vehicles (LMVs) : motorcars, light delivery vehicle (LDVs) and
motorcycles; as well as minibuses not registered to transport passengers
for reward;

e Minibus taxis : minibuses registered to transport passengers for reward;

e Buses : for the transportation of 18 and more passengers; and

e Trucks : for the transportation of freight > 3,5 t.

Offence surveys are conducted on roads and streets in urban and rural areas
which are defined as follows:
e Urban areas : local roads and streets in cities, towns and built-up areas
where the speed limit may vary between 60km/h to 80km/h;
e Rural areas : including inter-city, inter-regional and inter-provincial roads,
which may be national, provincial and regional roads with speed limits
generally between 100km/h and 120km/h.

In order to enable the comparison of the different types of traffic offences on an
equal basis, index numbers were developed. Without such indices it would be
difficult to compare and sum offence which are measured in different terms, for
example, “milligrams per litre’ (alcohol); “kilometres per hour” (speed) or
“percentage of red phases with offence” (skipping traffic signals). By reducing all
these offences to index numbers which relate the offence levels to their respective
targets, the rates of the different offences become mutually comparable and can
also be used to calculate combined (or joint) indices for the different offences.

n order to assist in the calculation of indices, desired maximum offence rates for
the various types of traffic offences were determined. These are given in Table 64
below.

Table 64 : Desired maximum offence rates for various critical offences

Offence Type Desired maximum (standard) offence rate
5% - not more than 5 out of every 100 vehicles measured
Speed a ;
exceed the set speed limit on a particular road or street
Alcohol 0,4% - not more than 1 driver in every 250 tested exceed
the legal breath alcohol limit
Barrier line 1% - 1 illegal overtaking offence across a barrier or no-

overtaking line for every 100 traffic convoys observed
1% - maximum of 1% of red phases with an offence where
the driver of any vehicle failed to clear the junction in time

Traffic signals

63

--- Page 64 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — March 2009

Seat belts 15% - maximum of 15 vehicle occupants, drivers and
passengers, fail to wear seatbelts

1% - maximum of 1 driver out of every 100 interviewed fail
to carry or produce a valid driving licence

1% - maximum of 1 driver of a public passenger or freight
PrDP transport vehicle out of every 100 interviewed fail to carry
or produce a valid professional driving permit

1% - maximum of 1 tyre out of every 100 tested are
damaged or worn below the legal limit

1% - maximum of 1 light (head, tail and brake lights) out of
every 100 tested are not functioning properly

Driving licence

Vehicle tyres

Vehicle lights

The index numbers or indices have been formulated in such a way that all these
standards are expressed as 1 index unit. This means that when any of these
standards have been reached, the index number of that offence will be equal to 1.
For example: An index number of 1 for alcohol offences would mean that an
offence rate of 0,4% was observed during the survey (this is exactly on the
standard rate of 0,4%). An index number of 0,5 for seat belts would mean that an
offence rate of 7,5% was observed during the survey (this is 0,5 times the
standard rate of 15%). An index number of 2,0 for speeding offences would mean
that an offence rate of 10% was observed during the survey (this is 2 times the
standard rate of 5%).

Combined offence index numbers or indices across all types of traffic offences are
calculated because they represent the joint results for various offences on a
provincial and national basis. These combined indices support the addition of the
various percentages across the various types of offences in order to allow for the
comparison of annual and provincial traffic offence results.

8.2 2008 Traffic offence Survey : Driver and Vehicle Profiles

As for previous years, the 2008 survey was carried out in accordance within the
required levels of accuracy with regard to the various minimum sample sizes for
the various types of road traffic offences. These requirements were:
e Local authority level : 90% Level of Confidence (LOC) with a confidence
interval of 5%.
e Provincial level : 95% Level of Confidence (LOC) with a confidence interval
of 5%.
e National level : 99% Level of Confidence (LOC) with a confidence interval of
3%.

During the 2008 traffic offence survey a total of 10,049 drivers across all vehicle
types were interviewed, on average in the order of about per province. Detail per

province and age group is given in Table 65 and reflected in the graph below.

Based on the above indices and accompanying percentages of the various types
of offences, estimates were made of the number of drivers on the road that may
not have a valid driving licence or professional driving permit (PrDP); as well as
the number of vehicles, per type of vehicle, that may be fitted with worn or

damaged tyres or defect lights. These estimates fro 2008 in comparison with
those for 2007 are given in Table 70 below.

The information above shows that on a national basis, on average 42,00% of
trucks exceed the speed limit in rural areas during day-time on all days of the
week, in comparison with 45,00% exceeding the speed limit during night-time.
However, in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo and the Northern Cape, the percentage of
trucks exceeding the limit during night-time is lower than during day-time. The
night-time offence rate in the Western Cape is 65,80%, which is also the highest
amongst all provinces.

General :

The number of vehicles per type of vehicle that were measured for speed during
the 2008 survey is given in Table 94 below.

Table 94 : Number of Vehicles in speed measurements

Time of day LMV_ | MB Taxi Bus Truck Total
Speed Day 37,668 7,775 1,534 10,356] 57,333)

[Total vehicles 61,481} 12,482) 2,197} 16,763) 92,923]

Although there were some slight decreases recorded, in general the percentage of
vehicles that exceed the speed limit in both urban and rural areas at any time of
the day and day of the week remains unacceptably high. All traffic authorities
should endeavour to increase enforcement in this regard.

Excessive speed and exceeding the set limits, contributes to the occurrence and
severity of road crashes insofar as it:
e Reduces observation and reaction time to sudden dangers and
pedestrians, particularly children and the elderly on the road;
e Leads to the committing of other offences, such as un-safe and illegal
overtaking; ignoring red traffic signals, stop signs, etc;
e Increases the impact at which crashes happen resulting in more persons
killed and more severe injuries;

The information above shows that there was a national increase in the percentage
of drivers of light motor vehicles that are not wearing seatbelts, from 51.80% in
2007 to 63,60% in 2008. The biggest increase was recorded in Limpopo where the
non-wearing rate increased from 49,00% in 2007 to 71,70% in 2008. The
provinces with the highest non-wearing seatbelt rates for drivers in 2008 are :

Historic surveys in this regard also provided for observations during roadblocks.
Information on driver non-wearing rates during the so-called observed surveys at
roadblocks from 2004 to 2007 is given in Table 108 and also reflected in the graph
below.

The information below shows relatively low non-wearing rates for drivers. There
was also a perceived national decrease in the non-wearing rate from 30% in 2006
to a rate of 8,19% in 2007. The fact of the matter is that drivers in the past, as well
as some passengers, on approach to a roadblock quickly fastened their seatbelts,
thus providing of a more acceptable standard than shown in Table 107 above.

The information above shows that there is a vast difference in the results of the 2
survey methodologies — the roadblock results in 2007 showing a much lower non-
wearing rate than the observed rate in 2008. These results lead to the decision to
conduct seatbelt wearing rate surveys in future only from an “un-observed”
position.

Seatbelts : % Non-wearing rates for Front Seat Passengers

Information on seatbelt non-wearing rates for front seat passengers of light motor
vehicles during surveys at roadblocks in 2007 and un-observed surveys at traffic

Based on the above discussion on roadblock and un-observed surveys for drivers,
the information in table 102 reflects a similar pattern for front seat passengers — in
the past they also quickly fastened their seatbelts on approaching a roadblock.

The decision to conduct seatbelt wearing surveys in future only form an un-
observed point of view, lead to the unfortunate situation that information in this

The information above indicates an overall unacceptable high offence rates in
most provinces in the order of about 90% of backseat passengers not wearing
seatbelts. The information is further indicating that, unlike in the case of drivers
and front seat passengers, passengers in the back seat did not bother much to
fasten their seatbelts on the approach to a roadblock.

--- Page 101 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — March 2009

Over the past few years there was a continuous increase in the number of
passengers killed in road crashes. The wearing of seatbelts, particularly by
passengers in the backseat should be improved drastically. In this regard it is
recommended that seatbelt surveys for backseat passengers be continued at
roadblocks during future years and should also include the use of child restraints,
in order to improve the monitoring, evaluation and control of the level of
lawlessness in this regard.

8.8 Traffic signal offence rates

Information on traffic signal offences were recorded as follows : Where vehicles
passed the stop line after the signal controlling their movement turned red, it was
recorded as an offence. However, where vehicles turned right in the face of the
red light after waiting for oncoming traffic during the green or amber phases, the
movement was not recorded as an offence if the front wheels were already over
the stop line when the light turned red.

The information in Table 112 below shows that there was an increase of 61,96%
from 18,40 in 2007 to 29,80 in 2008 in the traffic signal offence index in urban
areas during day-time by drivers of all categories of vehicles. The information is
also schematically depicted in the graph below.

8.9 Overtaking offence rates

In the survey of barrier line (overtaking) offences, an offence was recorded when
any wheel or wheels of a vehicle crossed the barrier line. Only convoys of vehicles
travelling next to no-overtaking lines were recorded, thus only recording the event
when the driver of the offending vehicle was following another vehicle or vehicles,
and there was an opportunity to commit an offence. The percentage of convoys in
which a single or multiple offences were committed was recorded.

The information in Table 115 below shows day-time and night-time barrier line (no
overtaking line) offence indices for 2008. The information is also schematically
depicted in the graph below.

The information above shows that, in general, there is very little correlation in the
change in the number of fatal crashes and the change in the overall combined
offence index. For example:
e National level : offence index increased by 1,47% and fatal crashes
decreased by 10,47%;

137

--- Page 138 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — March 2009

Gauteng : offence index increased by 0,33% and fatal crashes decreased
by 20,12%;

Western Cape : offence index increased by 3,31% and fatal crashes
decreased by 9,93%; and

North West : offence index increased by 0,23% and fatal crashes
decreased by 12,03%.

Exceptions in this regard are the following provinces which show a simultaneous
increase or decrease in traffic offences and fatal crashes from 2007 to 2008:

KwaZulu-Natal : offence index increased by 2,26% and fatal crashes
increased by 3,99%; and

Mpumalanga : offence index decreased by 0,90% and fatal crashes
decreased by 4,53%; and

Limpopo : offence index increased by 0,47% and fatal crashes increased by
2,51%.

Comparison between total Vehicles in Crashes and Offence Indices

Information on the comparison between the number of all vehicle involved in fatal

These 2 provinces, both of which showed increases in this regard, are the

following:

of trucks involved fatal crashes increased by 10,36%.

e Mpumalanga : defect light offences increased by 11,40% and the number of

for future improvements in the process are submitted for consideration :

8.20.4

8.20.5

8.20.6

8.20.7

The format and data required for both crashes and the various
offences per vehicle category should also be carefully re-considered
in order allow for improved analysis and making of comparisons
between crashes and the various types of offences;

Overloading of both passenger and freight vehicles is a contributing
factor to crashes. In this regard it is recommended that minibus taxis
and buses also be checked and recorded for possible passenger
overload during future surveys;

Overloading of freight transport vehicles is the most significant
contributor towards the deterioration of any pavement surface.
Some of the traffic counters operated by the South African National
Roads Agency Limited (SANRAL); as well as some Provincial
Government Departments also collects High Speed Weigh In Motion
(HSWIM) data. The HSWIM information includes E80 axle loads for
heavy vehicles. Accurate data for vehicle mass can therefore be
calculated from this information. It is recommended that vehicle
overloading information collected from HSWIM counters should be
included as part of future Traffic Offence surveys.

A major logistical challenge during the field surveys was to ensure
that traffic officers attend all the road blocks. Several road blocks
could not be held due to the absence of traffic officers being present.
Although a great improvement was experienced in 2008 in
comparison with the 2007 survey, it is recommended that much
more attention should be paid to this issue, and that a dedicated
traffic officer per Province to attend to all road blocks be made
available for future surveys.

9. The National Traffic Call Centre

The National Traffic Call Centre (NTCC) was established with the purpose the provide
the public with a centre where traffic offences can be reported. Road users and members
of the public register as Voluntary Public Traffic Observers (VPTOs) in order to expedite
the reporting process, as well as to monitor and control possible misuse.

The number of VPTOs registered for the past 2 financial years is given in Table 169 and

reflected in the graph below. On a national basis there were a total
registered on the system on 31 March 2009.

It should be noted that the apparent decrease in the number of offence reports for the
2008-2009 financial year is due to offences that was reported and not finalised yet, thus

resulting in a backlog of an un-known number of offences to be finalised. The backlog
was mainly contributed to by ;

¢ Computer problems;
e Lack of personnel; as well as

e« The cumbersome procedure to check, control and verify vehicle data on the
Na TIS.

Due to problems that are being experienced with the software program that is used for
the recording of the reported offences, no report on the number offences reported per
type of offence could be generated.

Conclusion

Increases in the “level of lawlessness” in terms of un-roadworthy and un-licenced
vehicles in some provinces; as well as high numbers of expired driving licences and
PrDPs were recorded over the 12-month reporting period.

Despite these increases, the information contained in this report clearly indicates a
steady decrease in both the national number of fatal crashes and fatalities; as well as
rates and trends per 10,000 motorised vehicles and distance travelled over about the
past 24 months (approximately 20 to 24 months). Most of the provinces contributed to
these favourable decreases in rates and trends.

Due to a general lack in available “output” information, particularly with regard to law
enforcement information, such as the number of driver and vehicle controls (number of
drivers and vehicles stopped and checked for fitness); number of drivers arrested and
vehicles suspended; the number of notices issued per type of traffic violation, etc per
Province, it is not possible to determine the cause/s or main contributors to the recorded
decreases in crashes, fatalities and rates.

An improvement in the preparation and submission of accurate monthly enforcement
performance reports in particular, is essential to better analyse and report on factors that
contribute to improvements in road safety.

With regard to the 2008 road traffic offence survey the following issues need to be taken

cognisance of :

(a) Although the general trend of the level of lawlessness over the past few years is
decreasing, the study also found that, as in the past, offence levels on South
African roads and the related levels of risk are still extremely high. In particular, the
involvement of the transport industry and professional drivers in some of the
serious offences was noted.

(b) | Ona national basis, the overall traffic offence index increased by 27,84% from an
index of 5,28 in 2007 to an index of 6,75 in 2008, indicating that the initial
decrease in offences may start rising again, thus calling for increased levels of
enforcement, particularly with regard to all the critical offences as indicated.

(c) | The most important offences to focus on, as identified in the 2008 survey, are:

e Exceeding the speed limit : High levels of speeding offences were observed.
Speed discipline must be restored on South African roads and community
leaders on all levels should set an example.

165

Road Traffic Management Corporation

Road Traffic Report — March 2009

Driving under the influence of Alcohol : Extremely high levels of drunk-driving
were encountered. All vehicle classes were involved. The high offence
incidence among professional drivers in general and drivers of minibus taxis in
particular was noted. Alcohol control should be stepped up and the penalties

be severe.

Barrier line offences : The huge (and growing) contribution of this offence to
the dangerous situation on our roads and the contribution of these offences to

head-on crashes with a high severity, should be recognised.

Smooth and damaged tyres : Serious problems with tyres of vehicles, including
trucks and taxis were found on the road. Reasons for serious deterioration of
tyres and for the apparent neglect of tyres by a large proportion of vehicle
owners, professional drivers and the freight and passenger transport industries

should be investigated.

It is recommended that a renewed, innovative, systematic and well coordinated law
enforcement plan of action; fully supported by an effective and efficient communication
and education programme be introduced in order to bring the rising levels of lawlessness
better under control.

1 Road traffic crash | A road traffic crash is an accident, event, collision or crash between two or
more vehicles, a vehicle and a train, a vehicle and a cyclist, a vehicle and
a pedestrian, a vehicle and an animal, a vehicle and a fixed object, such
as a bridge, building, tree, post, etc, or a single vehicle that overturned on
or near a public road. A road traffic crash is a single road traffic incident,
regardless of the number of vehicles or persons involved in any particular
crash. In short : a road crash happens when two road users, regardless of
mode of travel, try to occupy the same road space at the same time.

2 Crash categories | Categories or Degrees of Crashes : Road traffic crashes are classified in

the following four categories in accordance with the severity thereof :

« Fatal crash : a crash resulting in the death of one or more persons.
The persons killed may be drivers and passengers of vehicles, or
cyclists and pedestrians. Such crashes can include serious and slight
injuries.

« Major crash : a crash in which one or more persons are seriously
injured and can include slight injuries.

e Minor crash : a crash in which one or more persons are slightly
injured.

The above three categories of crashes are jointly referred to as casualty

crashes.

« Damage only crash : a crash in which no-one was killed or injured
and resulted in damage to the vehicle or vehicles and/or other property

only.
3 Casualty Categories or Degrees of Casualties : Road traffic casualties or injuries
categories are classified in the following three categories in accordance with the
severity thereof :

« Fatality : person or persons killed during or immediately after a crash,
or death within 6 days after a crash happened as a direct result of
such crash. (Also see item 17 below for international definition).

e Serious injury : person/s sustained injuries to such an extent that
hospitalisation is required. Serious injuries include fractures,
crushings, concussion, internal injuries, severe cuts and lacerations,
severe shock, etc which require medical treatment, hospitalisation
and/or confinement to bed.

¢ Slight injury : person/s sustained minor cuts and bruises, sprains and
light shock which may be treated at the scene of the crash or at home.

4 Crash rates e Crash rate per the registered vehicle population : The crash rate
per 10 000 vehicle population is calculated by dividing the number of
crashes by the vehicle population, in ten thousands, of the relevant
region, province or country.

« Crash rate per distance or kilometres travelled by vehicles: The
crash rate per 100 million vehicle kilometres travelled is calculated by
dividing the number of crashes by the combined distance travelled by

Definition

all motorised vehicles, in hundred millions, within the relevant region,
province or country. The distance travelled is usually calculated in
terms of the number of the different types of vehicles, mean fuel
consumption per vehicle type and fuel sales for a particular period.

Casualty rates

« Severity of Fatal Crashes or Fatality Rate : is the mean (average)
number of persons killed per fatal accident. This rate refers to the
severity of fatal crashes - the more persons killed per fatal crash the
more severe the accident. More severe crashes are indicative of the
higher impact of such crashes, possibly resulting from higher speeds,
drivers and passengers not wearing seatbelts, or more vehicles
involved in single crashes (number of vehicles per crash), or more high
occupancy vehicles, such as buses and minibuses involved in
accidents.

« Casualty rate : the mean total number of casualties (deaths and
serious and slight injuries) per casualty crash.

¢ Fatality rate per human population : The fatality rate per 100 000
population is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the
population, in hundred thousands, of the relevant region, province or
country.

¢ Casualty rate per human population : Similar to the fatality rate, the
casualty rate per 100 000 population is calculated by dividing the total
number of casualties by the population, in hundred thousands, of the
relevant region, province or country.

« Fatality rate per vehicle population : The fatality rate per 10 000
vehicles is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the vehicle
population, in ten thousands, of the relevant region, province or
country.

« Casualty rate per vehicle population : The casualty rate per 10 000
vehicles is calculated by dividing the total number of casualties by the
vehicle population, in ten thousands, of the relevant region, province
or country.

« Fatality rate per distance travelled : The fatality rate per 100 million
vehicle kilometres (mvk) travelled is calculated by dividing the number
of fatalities by the distance travelled, in 100 mvk, of the relevant
region, province or country.

« Casualty rate per distance travelled : The casualty rate per 100
million vehicle kilometres (mvk) travelled is calculated by dividing the
total number of casualties by the distance travelled, in 100 mvk, of the
relevant region, province or country.

Trends

Trends are used to indicate increases or decreases in the number of
crashes, fatalities, casualties and rates. Trends are usually expressed in
terms of percentage (%) increase or decrease from the previous
corresponding period to the current period under consideration, usually
one year.

Equivalent
Accident Number
(EAN)

In order to identify and rank hazardous sections of road, or junctions of
roads, the various categories (or degrees of crashes - fatal, major, minor
and damage only) have to be weighted and added together for each
section of road between 2 known nodes, or junctions, to determine the
crash factor or Equivalent Accident Number (EAN) for each link or node.

Definition

The weighting of crashes for the purpose of calculating the EAN is based
on the ratio between the costs of the various types of crashes (2008
figures) as shown in the table below. For example, the weight of a damage
only crash equals one (1); while the cost of major crash is 6,55 times
higher and that of a fatal crash 16,63 times.

Weighting of Crash Cost for EAN Calculations
Crash Type Cost R million Weight
Fatal 1,174,189 16,63
Major 462,664 6,55
Minor 253,721 3,59
Damage 70,623] 1,00

Hazardous sections of road are rated in terms of EAN per 10km of road or
EAN per mvk travelled, if known for all the sections of road under
consideration for rating. The Severity Index (SI) per road link, for ranking
purposes, is the EAN divided by the total number of crashes for that link.
(SI = EAN / No. of crashes).

Number of
registered
vehicles

The number of registered vehicles is the number as registered on the
National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at 24:00 on the last
day of each month. This figure takes cognisance of the number of new or
re-registrations and the number of vehicle de-registrations during the
month. It should be noted that vehicles that were written-off because of a
crash, are not necessarily scrapped or de-registered during the same
month that the crash happened.

Un-Roadworthy
Vehicles

Un-roadworthy vehicles is defined as those of which the owners failed to
submit the vehicles for compulsory annual roadworthy tests (including
buses, minibus taxis and freight transport vehicles) or on change of
ownership.

The number of un-roadworthy vehicles is the number marked as un-
roadworthy on the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at
24:00 on the last day of each month.

10

Un-Licenced
Vehicles

Un-licenced vehicles are those of which the owners failed to renew the
vehicle licences within the 21 day grace period allowed.

The number of un-licenced vehicles is the number marked as un-licenced
on the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at 24:00 on the
last day of each month.

11

Learner Driving
Licences

Learner driving licences are categorised as follows:

« Category 1 : Motorcycle

e Category 2 : Light Motor Vehicle

« Category 3 : Heavy Motor Vehicle

The number of registered learner licences is the number as registered on
the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at 24:00 on the
last day of each month. This figure takes cognisance of the number of new
registrations and the number of de-registrations (cancellations, which
include expired learner licences and licences becoming invalid because of
a driving licence obtained by the holder) during the month.

14 | All fuel sales The total fuel sales figures in terms of petrol and diesel sales in number of
litres sold per province per month, are obtained from SAPIA, and more
recently from Response Group Trendline (RGT — affiliated to NAAMSA) in
the order of about 6 weeks after the end of each particular month.

15 Fuel sales for The estimated fuel sales for road use is calculated in terms of the

road use recommendations contained in the CSIR research report CR-2002/79, in
accordance with which 98% of all petrol sales and 70% of all diesel sales
are for road usage.

16 | Distance The estimated distance travelled per type of vehicle per province per

travelled month is calculated in terms of the recommendations contained in the

CSIR research report CR-2002/79 and based on the average number of
vehicles per fuel type (petrol and diesel) as registered on NaTIS and the
fuel sales per fuel type for road use for each particular month.

The percentage (%) allocation of the total estimated types of fuel for road
usage per type of vehicle (in accordance with CSIR research report CR-
2002/79) is as shown in the table below:
