DATA MANAGEMENT
Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the
primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provides the Corporation with a list
of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the Corporation receive
the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic Management
Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data in order to compile a report.

Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are submitted to the
Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

Data processing

Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) captures, processes and verifies all
the data received and captured in order to compile a consolidate report. There is a

continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

8. Conclusion

Most people obtain learner licence for category 3 (heavy motor vehicle),
subsequently most driver licences issued are for category B (motor vehicle < 3,5000
kg), C1 (motor vehicle <3,5000 kg) and EB (articulated motor vehicle < 16,000kg).
Taking cognisance that not everyone with learner licence and driver licence issued

own vehicles and drive more often.

There were 2 399 fatal crashes recorded during the period under review with 2 962
fatalities. Most fatalities were recorded for pedestrians with a contribution of 37%
followed by passenger's contribution of 35%. The information depicts that of the
total number of fatalities there were 76% representing fatalities for males during the
crashes and 24% for females. Most of crashes occurred between 17:00 to 23:00
with a contribution of 39%. Most vehicles involved in the crashes were motorcars
and LDV with 49% and 21% respectively. Furthermore, most crashes occurred as a

result of human factors.

There were 34 major crashes reported and investigated during this period where
165 persons were killed and 161 sustained injuries in the crashes. Out of 34 major

crashes, 91% were as a results of human factors while 9% were vehicle factors.

There is a need to strengthen the Law Enforcement operations to address among
others the vehicle roadworthiness and passenger's safety. The information shows
