2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report seeks to provide the preliminary road crash statistics. The
performance is for the period between April — June 2019. The performance per

each focus areas have been provided below.
Road Crashes Data

A total number of 1 628 fatalities were recorded for the period between April to
June 2019 from 1 314 fatal crashes. That resulted in a decrease of 24% from

2018. The most affected road users were pedestrians and passengers.

A total number of twenty-eight (28) major crashes were reported and
investigated during this period. Two-hundred and three (203) persons were
killed and one-hundred and ninety-six (196) persons sustained injuries in the

major crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 242 038 (1.96%) from 12 348
522 on 30 June 2018 to 12 590 560 vehicles on 30 June 2019.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 14 304 (1.20%)
from 1192 926 on 30 June 2018 to 1 178 622 on 30 June 2019.

--- Page 9 ---
The number of driving licences issued increased by 486 253 (3.80%) from
12 807 403 on 30 June 2018 to 13 293 656 on 30 June 2019.

SECTION A
. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between April and June 2019 using the CHoCOR Forms. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-
roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licences and professional driving
permits issued from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), Law
Enforcement and Road Safety information. Furthermore, its includes
information about population growth using the 2018 mid-year population
estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to

the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

10

--- Page 11 ---
A

Road Tatil
2.3. Data processing

The data is captured, processed and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with

provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.
2.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being

used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

3. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes. The section will
encompass the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality data per road user group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison during the 1%t quarters in 2018 and
2019. There was a decrease of 441 (25%) in comparison to the two quarters of
2018 and 2019 nationally. On a provincial level, seven (7) provinces recorded
a decrease while the other two (2) provinces recorded an increase in the
number of fatal crashes. The highest decrease was recorded for KwaZulu Natal
with 56% followed by Gauteng and North West with 43% and 38%

respectively.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and LDV’s with contributions of 44.5% and 21.2% respectively. Motor cars
recorded a decrease of 0.1% while LDV’s recorded a decrease of 1.4% in
comparison of the two periods. The two vehicle types may contribute to high

number of fatalities for passengers.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for April to June 2019 showed that human factors contributed
85.2% as compared to 88.1% recorded during April to June 2018. The roads
and environmental factors recorded 6% in 2018 and 10% in 2019 which shows

a significant increase of 3.4%.

by hit and run with a contribution of 10.9% in 2018 and 16.7% in 2019 which
increased by 5.8%. Speeding was still a challenge as it also contributed to fatal
crashes. The jay-walking and hit and run as depicted above correlate to a high

number of fatalities for pedestrians.
