3. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT
This report is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the Culpable
Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms and the inputs from Provincial

departments of transport; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced vehicles,

4. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period July -

September 2022. The performance is provided below.
Road Crashes Data

A total number of 3 182 fatalities were recorded for the period between July -
September 2022 from 2 705 fatal crashes. As a result, there was an increase of 2.9%
fatalities from 2021 to 2022. The most affected road user group during 2022 are
pedestrians moving from 41.3% in the previous year 45.0% during the period under

review.

A total number of twenty-three (23) major crashes were reported and investigated for
the period under review. One-hundred and sixty-four (164) persons were killed in the

major crashes.
Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 258 535 (2.00%) from 12 958 011 on
30 September 2021 to 13 216 546 vehicles as at 30 September 2022

The number of learner driving licenses issued increased by 178 229(21,30%) from 932
367 as at 30 September 2021 to 1 110 596 as at 30 September 2022.

The number of driving licenses issued increased by 491 035 (3.44%) from 14 290 022
as at 30 September 2021 to 14 781 057 as at 30 September 2022.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued decreased by 65 793
(5.74%) from 1145 484 as at 30 September 2021 to 1079 691 as at 30 September
2022

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to police
stations between July and September 2021 and 2022 using the CHoCOR Form. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-roadworthy and
un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued from the
National Traffic Information System (NaTIS). Furthermore, it includes information about
population growth using the 2022 mid-year population estimates from Statistics South
Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to collect
fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the primary
source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation with a list of all recorded
fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms
from various police stations. Road Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes

and verifies the data to compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the Corporation

either by fax, email or through the phone.

Road Traffic

Sement Corporation

2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical report.

There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal crashes
only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to collect scientific base

facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Sample

Sampling is not applicable for fatal crashes routine or administrative data as the data is

collected as they occurred within the country from all nine (9) provinces.

2.6 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being used by

Road Traffic Information unit to record fatal road crash data on daily basis.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which encompasses the
number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality information per road

user group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. There was an increase of
63 (2.4%) from 2 642 to 2 705 in comparison to quarter 2 of 2021 and 2022. However,
on a provincial level Eastern Cape, Free State, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Limpopo had

decreases in fatal crashes. The highest increase was in Western Cape at 56.2%.

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars and Light
Delivery Vehicles with contributions of 38.7% and 16.7% respectively during 2022.

Both motor cars and Light Delivery Vehicles decrease compared to the previous year.

3.6 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows: human factors
(defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are valid for all users
regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle itself and they cover
issues around mechanical failures; and environment (include limited visibility, poorly
marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road,

the state of the road and weather conditions).

The human factors remained to be the highest amongst the three contributory factors.

The figure below shows that fatal crashes for July - September 2022 occurred due to

human factors with a contribution of 88.6%. Whilst roads and vehicle factors and
