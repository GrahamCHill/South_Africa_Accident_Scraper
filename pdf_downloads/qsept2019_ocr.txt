SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to police
stations between July and September 2018 and 2019 using the CHoCOR Form. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-roadworthy and
un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued from the
National Traffic Information System (NaTIS). Furthermore, it includes information about
population growth using the 2019 mid-year population estimates from Statistics South
Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to collect
fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the primary
source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation with a list of all recorded
fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms
from various police stations. Road Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes

and verifies the data to compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the Corporation
either by fax, email or through the phone.

2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical report.
There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

--- Page 12 ---
YA

Road Traffic
2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal crashes
only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to collect scientific base
facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Sample

Sampling is not applicable for fatal crashes routine or administrative data as the data is
collected as they occurred within the country from all nine (9) provinces.

2.6 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being used by
Road Traffic Information unit to record fatal road crash data on daily basis.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which encompasses the
number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality information. per road
user group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. There was a decrease of 591
(21.3%) from 2 769 to 2 178 in comparison to quarter 2 of 2018 and 2019. However, on a
Provincial level all provinces recorded a decrease in this regard with the exception of Northern
Cape and Eastern Cape. The highest decrease was recorded for Gauteng with 42% followed by
KwaZulu Natal with 38.4%.

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars and
LDV’s with contributions of 45.8% and 19.9% respectively during 2019. The two vehicle
types may contribute to high number of fatalities for passengers.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows: human factors
(defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are valid for all users
regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle itself and they cover
issues around mechanical failures; and environment (include limited visibility, poorly
marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road,
the state of the road and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for July - September 2019 showed that human factors contributed
83% to the occurrence of fatal crashes followed by roads and environmental factors at
10%; and vehicle factors with a contribution of 6%.

factors occurred were due to Driver/ Human Error which increased by 9% from 80%
in 2018. The vehicle factor contributed 4% to the major crashes which decreased by
8% from 12% in 2018. The road and environment contributed 7% to the major
crashes which reduced by 1% from 8% in 2018.
