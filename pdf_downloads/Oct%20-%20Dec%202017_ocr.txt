The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 48 557 (3.85%)
from 1 262 261 on 31 December 2016 to 1 213 704 on 31 December 2017.
The number of driving licences issued increased by 495 322 (4.07%) from
12 162 813 on 31 December 2016 to 12 658 135 as of 31 December 2017.

Law Enforcement and Road Safety performance

Road Safety unit conducted the following activities during the period under
review (quarter 3). In relation to Youth program the conducted driver
education workshop with young drivers from 9 provinces.

Furthermore, the unit monitored the implementation of Community based
structure which are aimed at addressing contributory factors to hazardous
locations within identified communities.

Over and above the unit coordinated the implementation of the driver
awareness with interest group more especially the Freight industry which was
identified as a priority during quarter 3.

A total number of vehicles stopped for 2016 were 2 159 833 compared to
2 914 906 in 2017 with an an icrease of 26%.

Out of a total of vehicles stopped, a total of 506 405 and 912 985 traffic
notices were issued in the same period during 2016 and 2017.

Over and above notices issued, arrests were made following the severity of
offences, total of 10 255 and 13 982 arrests were reported during the period
under review in 2016 and 2017 calendar year. These arrests and offences

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between October and December 2017 using the CHoCOR Forms.
In addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-
roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and professional driving
permits issued from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), Law
Enforcement and Road Safety information. Furthermore, its includes
information about population growth using the 2017 mid-year population
estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to
compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to
the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

10

--- Page 13 ---
oa
2.3 Data processing

The data is captured, processed and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with
provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to
collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Road Safety

The Corporation develops programmes to coordinate and monitor the
implementation of the programmes across the 9 provinces. The reports
compiled by the different implementing agents namely youth structure,
community-based structure and interest group (Freight company, etc) are
used as the source of data.

2.6 Law Enforcement

The Law Enforcement Unit is primarily responsible for the harmonization and
alignment of road traffic enforcement operations within the three spheres of
government. The data is collected through reporting templates.

2.7. Sample

Sampling is not applicable for fatal crashes routine or administrative data as
the data is collected as they occurred within the country from all nine (9)
provinces. There is no sampling for Road Safety and Law Enforcement.

2.8 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being
used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

Road Safety and Enforcement use the following tools among others for
administrative data collection questionnaires, templates, reports, registers and
presentations. Provinces record information on National Rollout Enforcement
Plan (NREP) and EMISA forms while Road Traffic Inspectorate records
information on Inspectorate forms, these reports are submitted to RTMC on
monthly basis for consolidation of a National report.

3. ROAD FATAL CRASHES ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes. The section will
encompass the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality
data per road user group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table above provides a comparison between two quarters. There was a reduction
of 100 (3.1%) in comparison to Quarter 3 of 2016 and 2017. However, on a provincial
level all provinces recorded a reduction in this regard with except of Limpopo and
Western Cape. The highest decrease was recorded for Northern Cape with 12.6%
followed by North West with 10.2%.

3.3 Contributory factors

To determine the contributory factors for fatal crashes, the contributory factors
are classified human factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and
limitations that are valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more
focussed on the vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures;
and environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road
and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for Oct-Dec 2017 showed that human factors contributed
86.5% to the occurrence of fatal crashes followed by roads and environmental
factors at 7.7%; and vehicle factors with a contribution of 5.7%

LAW ENFORCEMENT

The 365 Road Safety Plan prescribes targets for stop and check as well
as drunken driving arrests per province. It is through this report the
unit can measure performance of provinces against the set targets as
well as be able to evaluate impact and possible intervention seeking
areas. It also assists in identifying areas of best practices which can be
followed up for possible roll-out to other provinces and authorities. The
target set for the for traffic law enforcement authorities to stop and
check vehicles for roadworthy status is 1 100 000 per month and has
been divided amongst provinces following the vehicle population as well
as number of authorities per province.

3.1 Law Enforcement Arrests

Drunk and driving is one of the biggest threads to Road Safety in the
country since it slows reaction time and distorts the driver’s vision. This
offence has implications where one could lose life, be prosecuted, vehicle
damage, or imprisonment depending on alcohol levels found in the blood
when tested by law enforcement officers. In order to reduce high rate of
drunk and driving, law enforcement agencies took responsibility to
conduct operations, targeting areas and events where most alcohol is
consumed, as well as routes used by motorist when travelling to various
destinations. In terms of statistics, Gauteng was the leading Province in
terms of drunken driving arrests while Free State has reported to have
made more arrests on speed. Due to increased number of public
