SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between April and June 2018 using the CHoCOR Forms. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-
roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licences and professional driving
permits issued from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), Law
Enforcement and Road Safety information. Furthermore, its includes
information about population growth using the 2017 mid-year population
estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to
the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

10

--- Page 13 ---
Sinagetent Corpse

2.3 Data processing

The data is captured, processed and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with

provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to
collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Road Safety

The Corporation develops programmes to coordinate and monitor the
implementation of the programmes across the 9 provinces. The reports
compiled by the different implementing agents namely youth structure,
community-based structure and interest group (Freight company, etc) are
used as the source of data.

2.6 Law Enforcement

The Law Enforcement Unit is primarily responsible for the harmonization and
alignment of road traffic enforcement operations within the three spheres of
government. The data is collected through reporting templates.

2.7 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being
used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

11

--- Page 14 ---
Management Cogresion

Road Safety and Enforcement use the following tools among others for
administrative data collection questionnaires, templates, reports, registers and
presentations. Provinces record information on National Rollout Enforcement
Plan (NREP) and EMISA forms while Road Traffic Inspectorate records
information on Inspectorate forms, these reports are submitted to RTMC on
monthly basis for consolidation of a National report.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and LDV’s with contributions of 47% and 19,8% respectively during quarter 1
in 2018. Motor cars recorded a decrease of 0,4% while LDV’s recorded a
decrease of 0,2% in comparison of the two periods. The two vehicle types may

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for April to June 2018 showed that human factors contributed
88,5% as compared to 83% recorded during April to June 2017, which depicts
an increase of 5,5%. The roads and environmental factors recorded 10,1% in
2017 and 4,8% in 2018 which shows a significant reduction of 5.3%. Human
factors remain a challenge compared to other factors.

The information in the tables and figures above shows that on a national basis
the general overall mobility in terms of the number of persons per road vehicle
(vehicles that can reasonably transport passengers - motorcars, minibuses,
buses, motorcycles and LDV’s “bakkies”), improved by 1.70% from a national
average of 5.51 persons per vehicle at the end of June 2017 to 5.42 persons
per vehicle at the end of June 2018.

Although they do show some improvement, the “least mobile” Provinces
remain Eastern Cape with 10,39 persons per vehicle; followed by the Limpopo
with 10,06 persons per vehicle at the end of June 2018. The “most mobile”
Provinces are Kwa-Zulu Natal and the North West with an average of 8,03 and
7,61 persons per vehicle respectively at the end of June 2018.

3 LAW ENFORCEMENT

The Law Enforcement Unit is primarily responsible for the harmonization and
alignment of road traffic enforcement operations within the three spheres of
government. This is done through the coordination of quarterly technical
committee meetings comprising of various Law Enforcement Authorities as well
as representatives from South African Police Services. The targets prescribed
in the 365 Road Safety Plan (RSP) document are as a result of resolutions of
the above mentioned committee Transport Agencies.

The 365 RSP prescribes targets for stop and check as well as drunken driving
arrests per province. It is through this report the unit can measure
performance of provinces against the set targets as well as be able to evaluate
impact and possible intervention seeking areas. It also assists in identifying
areas of best practices which can be followed up for possible roll-out to other
provinces and authorities. The target set for the for traffic law enforcement
authorities to stop and check vehicles for roadworthy status is 1 100 000 per
month and has been divided amongst Provinces following the vehicle
population as well as number of authorities per province. Monthly reports are
consolidated to monitor performance and develop intervention strategies
where the need arise. A total of 2 588 902 were stopped and checked in 2018,
recording a decline 9% when compared to 2017 same period where 2 830 606
vehicles were stopped and checked. Figure below gives a breakdown of
provincial targets v/s performance.

As result of all vehicles which were stopped and checked for roadworthiness,

it is evident that road users do not comply with the National Road Traffic Act,
Act 93 of 1996. As showen in the table below. The biggest thereof is for speed.

Vehicles impounded and discontinued

Un-roadworthy vehicles can contribute to road crashes leading into the loss of
lives, this is clearly prescribed in the section 3F(a) or Section 3 I(a) of the
National Road Traffic Act, Act 93 of 1996 that when a vehicle is not roadworthy
be discontinued for road use and be taken to a testing station to be re-tested
for roadworthiness. The picture of reports received between April and June on
both 2017 and 2018 depict that most vehicles were discontinued in KwaZulu
Natal, Gauteng and Mpumalanga. Mpumalanga and Gauteng also recorded
the highest number of impounded vehicles. Reasons below provide indication

on discontinuation and impoundments of vehicles:

++ People travelling from Gauteng via N3 to visit various tourist destinations
in KZN
People travelling from KZN to GP due to school closures

+ People travelling on N3 between GP and KZN to attend various activities
during long weekends

+ Mozambique immigrants travelling back home via N4 (Mpumalanga:
Lebombo) during holidays and school closures

4 Zimbabwean immigrants travelling back home via Ni (Limpopo: Beit
Bridge) during holidays and school closures

| People visiting tourist destinations in MP travelling via N4

All movements mentioned above results into increased traffic volumes with
other road users failing to obtain necessary road permits which ultimately lead
to their vehicles being impounded and some being discontinued during
operations as they are found to be un-roadworthy. Figures below provides
breakdown of vehicles impounded and the discontinued ones.

3.1 Law Enforcement Arrests

Drunk and driving is one of the biggest threads to Road Safety in the country
since it slows reaction time and distorts the driver’s vision. This offence has
implications where one could lose life, be prosecuted, vehicle damage, or
imprisonment depending on alcohol levels found in the blood when tested by
law enforcement officers. In order to reduce high rate of drunk and driving, law
enforcement agencies took responsibility to conduct operations, targeting
areas and events where most alcohol is consumed, as well as routes used by
motorist when travelling to various destinations.

In terms of statistics, Gauteng was the leading Province in terms of drunken
driving arrests while Free State has reported to have made more arrests on
speed. Due to increased number of public transport violance in Kwa-Zulu
Natal, the province focused on increasing public transport operations to and
the said operations resulted into the province arresting more road users for
driving without permits. A figure below provides breakdown of arrests per
province per arrests. There is also a sharp increase in Warrents that was

executed during this period.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Based on the road crashes and fatalities provided in this report it indicates
that our challenges was driver and passenger fatalities during this period
under review. Furthermore, passengers and pedestrians between age group
0-9 is becoming a serious change as they have increased in comparison of
the two periods. The time the crashes happens is also of great concerns.

In conclusion, the following are recommended to address the identified

challenges:

e Road Safety education intervention plan targeting all road users
needs to be strengthened, and target implementations where high
pedestrian fatalities occurred. Consideration on the activity type will
also be done.

e Intensified marketing and Communication campaign in Community
radio stations to reach rural communities and pedestrians so as to
improve their level of awareness.

e The need to intensify monitoring and evaluation system during the
peak periods

e Increase Law Enforcement capacity to ensure intelligence deployment

in all critical areas, and at the right time
