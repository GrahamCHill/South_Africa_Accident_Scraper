1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT
This report is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the Culpable
Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced vehicles,

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period July -

September 2020. The performance is provided below.
Road Crashes Data

A total number of 2 561 fatalities were recorded for the period between July -
September 2020 from 2 157 fatal crashes. As a result there was a decrease of 2.5%
fatalities from 2019 to 2020. The most affected road user group during 2020 was the

pedestrians. However, passengers recorded a slight decrease of 2% from 31% to 29%.

A total number of eighteen (18) major crashes were reported and investigated for the
period under review. One-hundred and twelve (112) persons were killed and thirty-nine

(39) persons sustained injuries in these major crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 10 340 (0.08%) from 12 703 720 on 30
September 2019 to 12 714 060 vehicles as at 30 September 2020.

On a national basis the total number of vehicles that are either un-roadworthy, un-
licenced or both increased by 916 726 (82.39%) from 1112 722 vehicles as on 30
September 2018 to 2 029 448 vehicles as on 30 September 2020.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 225 601(19.04%) from
1 184 713 as at 30 September 2019 to 959 112 as at 30 September 2020.

The number of driving licences issued increased by 364 178 (2.71%) from 13 423 683

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to police
stations between July and September 2019 and 2020 using the CHoCOR Form. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-roadworthy and
un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued from the
National Traffic Information System (NaTIS). Furthermore, it includes information about
population growth using the 2020 mid-year population estimates from Statistics South
Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to collect
fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the primary
source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation with a list of all recorded
fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms
from various police stations. Road Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes

and verifies the data to compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the Corporation

either by fax, email or through the phone.
2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical report.

There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

Road Traffic

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal crashes
only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to collect scientific base

facts to complement the administrative data.

2.5 Sample

Sampling is not applicable for fatal crashes routine or administrative data as the data is

collected as they occurred within the country from all nine (9) provinces.
2.6 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being used by

Road Traffic Information unit to record fatal road crash data on daily basis.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which encompasses the
number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality information per road

user group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. There was a decrease of 21 (1%)
fatal crashes from 2 178 to 2 157 in comparison to quarter 2 of 2019 and 2020. However, on a
provincial level six (6) provinces recorded a decrease in this regard with the exception of
Gauteng, KwaZulu- Natal and North West. The highest decrease was recorded for Northern
Cape with 33.8% followed by Eastern Cape with 26.1%.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows: human factors
(defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are valid for all users
regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the vehicle itself and they cover
issues around mechanical failures; and environment (include limited visibility, poorly
marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road,

the state of the road and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for July - September 2020 showed that human factors contributed
88% to the occurrence of fatal crashes followed by roads and environmental factors at

7%; and vehicle factors with a contribution of 5%.

a person or persons are killed during or immediately after a crash, or death within 30
days after a crash happened as a direct result on such crash. This section encompassed
the number of fatalities and percentage distribution per road user group, gender, race

and per age.

5. MAJOR CRASHES

This section provides for all the major crashes for the period under review. Major
crashes are defined as Crashes where five (5) or more people died, crashes involving
vehicles carrying dangerous goods / hazardous chemicals where there is a fatality and a
spillage of the dangerous goods / hazardous chemicals, and any crash that the

Corporation deems necessary to investigate.

5.1 Number of major crashes

A total number of eighteen (18) major crashes were reported and investigated for the
period under review. One-hundred and twelve (112) persons were killed in the major

crashes and thirty-nine (39) persons sustained injuries in these major crashes.

The figure below indicates the number of major crashes recorded and investigated,
number of fatalities and injuries sustained during the period under review in comparison
with the previous year’s quarter. During the current period under review the number of
the major crashes reported, fatalities and injuries has decreased by 9, 49 and 212

respectively as compared to the previous year.

Figure 20: Vehicles involved in major crashes

The figure above depicts the vehicle types involved in the major crashes reported and
investigated during the second quarters of 2019 and 2020. A total of fifty-nine (59)
vehicles were involved during the second quarter of 2019 while during the second

quarter of 2020 there were thirty-eight (38) vehicles involved.

Contributory Factors in Major Crashes

The analysis from major fatal crashes report indicates that 89% of the contributory
factors occurred were due to Driver/ Human Error which remained the same in
comparison of the two quarters in 2019 and 2020. The vehicle factor contributed
11.1% to the major crashes which increased by 7.4% from 3.7% in 2019. The road
and environment contributed nothing to the major crashes during the current period
under review as compared to 7.4% during the past period.
