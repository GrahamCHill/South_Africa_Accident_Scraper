Data Sources

The Road Traffic Management Corporation (the Corporation) gathers
data from the South African Police Services, Provincial Traffic
Authorities, and Metropolitan Municipalities through Accident Report
Forms and the Quick Response forms which are obtained from police
stations where road accidents have been reported. Upon receipt of
these ‘Accident Report Forms’ the Metropolitan Municipalities,
Provincial Traffic Authorities and Corporation then captures the data
contained in the forms. The Accident Report forms captures data for all
crash types. The Quick Response forms, which are mainly used to
record fatal crashes, are captured only by the Corporation.

Other data sources are as follows; Natis for registered vehicles and
Statistics South Africa for human population data.

The Corporation also undertakes Road Traffic Offence Surveys on an
annual basis. The following are the objectives of these surveys:

e To determine the general level of lawlessness on our roads;

e To assist Corporation to determine the impact of intervention
strategies to promote road safety in the country.

e To monitor and evaluate the capacities of the Corporation and
traffic authorities to implement efficient and effective road safety

interventions.

e To assist the Traffic authorities to determine whether the road
users know and understand their rights and obligations to

promote road safety in the country.
i

e To determine the fitness of drivers ef and vehicles

e To determine the management capacity of the Corporation to
interpret the results and develop road safety policies and

strategies to reduce carnage on the road network.

Targets used for the survey

The target for the evaluation of the success of the level of compliance
by the road users are the following:

e Exceeding the speed limit: Maximum 5% defective rate (i.e. not more than
5% offenders)

e Exceeding the legal breath alcohol limit: Maximum of 0.4% defective rate
at any time of the day of night (i.e. not more than 1 offender in 250 drivers
tested found over the legal limit)

e Overtaking on a barrier line: Maximum of 1% barrier line offences (1
offence for every 100 convoys observed)

e Vehicles disobeying traffic signals: Maximum of 1% of red phases with an
offence

e Wearing of seat belts: Maximum 15% offence rate

e The use of child restraints: Maximum 15% offence rate

e Driving licence present and valid: Maximum 1% offence rate

e The validity of the vehicle licence discs and correlation between the
registration disc and number plate: Maximum 1% offence rate

e Professional Driving Permit (PrDP) present and valid: Maximum 1%
offence rate

e Worn vehicle tyres: Maximum 1% defective rate

e Vehicle lights defective: Maximum 1% defective rate

e The use of cellular phones while driving a vehicle: Maximum 1% offence
rate

e Pedestrians disobeying traffic signals: Maximum of 1% of red phases with
an offence

Note: See annexure K for survey sample sizes

Limitations

The Corporation further receives the CAS Analysis Report from the
South African Police Services. This particular report assists with data
validation of the data already received from the various Police Stations
regarding fatal crashes only.

In the reporting and capturing of road crash data it sometimes happens
that crashes are duplicated. The checking, cross-checking and
verification of data is a lengthy and time consuming manual process,
which amongst others involves the comparison of the initial data
received from individual police stations at the time of the crash with
that received from individual police stations at the time the crash with
that received from the central SAPS data base. The process also
involves the identification and elimination of duplicated reports; as well
as follow-ups on the un-confirmed crash data.

In most cases the data on the Quick Response Forms are mainly
fatalities that are reported are those recorded at the crash scene.

A reduction has been observed for variables for the period under

review:
a) Fatal Crashes (0.94%) from 10 948 to 10 845
b) Fatalities (0.86%) from 13 923 to 13 802
c) Un-roadworthy vehicles (7.01%) from 438 701 to 407 930

d) Number of fatal crashes per 10,000 motorised vehicles (3.46%)

Improve Data Quality
e Expansion of data sources
e Development of the new Crash Data Management System (CDIMS)

e Improve data collection and capturing

The following changes were observed in the SA averages for the different offences
used to calculate the overall offence index from the offence survey:

e The urban speed offence index decreased from 6.3 to 5.6.

e The rural speed offence index decreased from 7.9 to 5.6.

e The night time alcohol offence index decreased from 2.4 to 2.3.

e The unobserved seatbelt offence index for drivers decreased from 1.5 to 0.8.
e The day time traffic signal offence index decreased from 24.7 to 12.3.
e The day time barrier line offence index decreased from 16.1 to 10.3.
e The driver's license offence index decreased from 1.5 0.8.

e The PDRP offence index decreased from 2.0 to 0.8.

e The worn tyres offence index decreased from 6.8 to 5.6.

e The front bright light offence index decreased from 1.1 to 1.0.

e The tail light offence index decreased from 0.6 to 0.5.

The overall offence index has decreased from 5.6 to 4.2.

crashes and the change in the overall combined offence index. With exception of
KwaZulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Free State and Northern Cape, other provinces have
shown a correlation.

On a National level, the fatal crashes decreased by 0.94% and the offence index
decreased by 33.3%.

On a provincial basis the biggest decrease were recorded for:

e Gauteng : Fatal crashes decreased by 6.73% and offence index with 75.8%

e Mpumalanga : Fatal crashes decreased 7.67% and offence index with 72.2%

e North West : Fatal crashes decreased 11.60% and offence index with 41.7%

The down-ward trend of the variables above may be ATTRIBUTED to
the following programmes undertaken by RTMC for the period under

review:
e Number of vehicles stopped and screened = 7 734 766
e Number of notices issued = 2 976 868
e Number of vehicles discontinued / suspended / impounded

e Number of people arrested for all road traffic offences including driving whilst
under the influence, dangerous driving, fraudulent public passenger transport

documentation and other serious offences

Road Safety Education projects:

Scholar Patrol programme in all nine provinces : 2520 schools participated
Road Safety Schools Debates : 618 schools participated
Participatory Educational Techniques : 169 schools participated

There were other projects that were run such as:-

Brandhouse RTMC Number One Taxi Driver Campaign : 1380 taxi drivers
participated in the competition.

Professional Drivers Championships (Driver of the year — DOTY): 111
professional drivers participated in the championship.

1.1 Measuring Progress towards Achieving Target to Reduce Fatalities by 50%
by 2015

Based on the 2006 Millennium Development Goals, one of the goals of the 2015
Road Traffic Safety Management Plan is to reduce by half the rate of accident
atalities arising from road and other transport by 2015. In the development of the
2015 Plan it was agreed that the number of fatalities for the year 2007 would be
used as the benchmark on which the 50% reduction would be based. Using this
benchmark and the 50% target reduction, the maximum allowable number of
road fatalities per quarter per province up to the end of 2015 was calculated as
continuous reduced target figures over the 8 year period. These set targets for
he indicated quarters for each province and the RSA total, are shown in the
table below, shown as “Target” figures or maximum allowable number of
atalities.

Also shown in the table above are the “Actual” figures, which reflect the real
number of road fatalities recorded per province for the respective quarters as
indicated. Both the Target and Actual figures represent the 12-month rolling total
fatality figures per province and the RSA on a national basis.

The difference; as well as the percentage difference figures in the table shows
the difference between the set Target and Actual number of road fatalities. A
difference of “0” indicates that the set target of reducing the number of fatalities
was met. Differences smaller than “0” (<0) shows achievements better than what
is expected or required and differences larger than’0” (>0) shows that the
required targets were not achieved and reflects inadequate performance towards
reaching the desired goal per quarter and ultimately the 2015 goal.

The % difference in meeting the set targets per province is also reflected in the

The information in the table and graph above shows that better performing
provinces (Differences less than’0”) well on track towards achieving the goal of
reducing road fatalities by 50% by the year 2015, amongst others are:

¢ Gauteng : which is also continuously improving its performance from
-14,10% in March 2010 to -11,70% in March 2011;

e Western Cape : shows an improvement performance from -7.96% in
March 2010 to -4.71% in March 2011.

The provinces that are not performing as required, (Differences larger than “0”)
are the following:

--- Page 17 ---
e KwaZulu-Natal : overall the worst performing province, with even a
continuous increase in the quarterly number of road fatalities that
exceed the set quarterly targets for the province — ranging from
+31,00% in March 2010; +31,31% in June 2010 and +31,63% in
September 2010, 37,87% in December 2010 and lastly +38.20% in
March 2011.

The following provinces also were the biggest contributor to the RSA,
on a national basis not achieving its set target towards the end of the
review period:

e Eastern Cape: made no contribution towards achieving the 2015 goals.
Over the review period the performance of this province worsened
from +7,59% in March 2010 to +39,40% in March 2011.

e Limpopo: made no contribution towards achieving the 2015 goals.
Over the review period the performance of this province worsened
from +31,43% in March 2010 to +38,49% in March 2011.

Western Cape were operating close to the border-line with figures ranging
from -7,96% to -4.10% in March 2011 moving in a non-contributory
direction.

National - RSA : over the review period the national figures range from
+8,14% in March 2010 to +15,32% in March 2011.The country’s
performance towards the reduction of fatalities by 50% for the assessed
period is deteriorating. The worst performing provinces listed above,
contributed to this non-achieving trend, with the biggest negative influence
from KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Limpopo and Northern Cape.

10. Results of the 2010 Road Traffic Offence Survey

10.1 Introduction

Annually, the Corporation conducts an independent traffic offence survey to determine
the level of lawlessness on our roads with regards to selected critical road traffic
offences that mostly contribute to the occurrence of road crashes in the country.

The survey focused on the following offences:

e Speed-urban and rural (light, heavy vehicles and taxis);

e Traffic signal offences;

e Overtaking across barrier line;

e Alcohol levels;

e Driving licences present and valid;

e Wearing of seatbelts;

e Vehicle fitness;

e Correlation between vehicle registration plate and license disk;
e Pedestrian compliance; and

e Presence of traffic officers, pedestrians, cyclists and animals on the roads.

The RTMC conducts an independent annual traffic offence survey and the information
obtained from the survey is mainly used for the following purposes:

e To determine the level of legal compliance/non compliance amongst road users
on a year-on-year basis;

e To measure the effect and impact of road safety intervention strategies such as
communication, law enforcement programmes, amongst others;

¢ To inform and recommend intelligent transport systems;

e To inform and recommend automated law enforcement technologies and

e To complement existing traffic safety information as well as to identify factors that
contribute to road traffic crashes.

By comparing these rates on an annual basis, the long-term progress with regard to
traffic discipline, law compliance, quality and safety in road traffic can be measured,
monitored and evaluated.

A brief summary of the main offence indices for 2010 on a national level, in comparison

with those of 2009, is given in the table below:

Combined Index 5.6 42 1.4 -25%

The information in

he table above shows that, on a national level, the overall offence
index has decreased by 25% from an index of 5.6 in 2009 to an index of 4.2 in 2010.

An increase of 15.4%, 11.1% and 82.6% was observed for seatbelt drivers, front
passengers and brake lights from 2009 to 2010 respectively. Although a decrease has

64


--- Page 72 ---
been in observed other offences ,it needs to be emphasized that these indices are still
very high and very far from reaching the desired maximum offence rate of 5%.
The findings of these annual offence surveys assist prioritization of law enforcement

interventions. For instance the 2010 offence survey established that the most important
offences to focus on, as identified in the study, are amongst seatbelt drivers, front

passengers and brake lights.

The following changes were observed in the SA averages for the different offences
used to calculate the overall offence index:

e The urban speed offence index decreased from 6.3 to 5.6.

e The rural speed offence index decreased from 7.9 to 5.6.

e The night time alcohol offence index decreased from 2.4 to 2.3.

e The unobserved seatbelt offence index for drivers decreased from 1.5 to 0.8.

e The unobserved seatbelt offence index for front passengers increased from 4.5
to 5.0.

e The day time traffic signal offence index decreased from 24.7 to 12.3.

e The day time barrier line offence index decreased from 16.1 to 10.3.

e The driver's license offence index decreased from 1.5 0.8.

e The PDRP offence index decreased from 2.0 to 0.8.

e The worn tyres offence index decreased from 6.8 to 5.6.

e The front bright light offence index decreased from 1.1 to 1.0.

e The tail light offence index decreased from 0.6 to 0.5.

e The brake light offence index increased from 2.3 to 4.2.

The overall offence index has decreased from 5.6 to 4.2.

Limpopo : offence index decreased by 15.8% and fatal crashes decreased by
21.3%;

11. RECOMMENDATIONS

The most important offences to focus on, as identified in the study, are:

e Driving under the influence of Alcohol: Very high levels of drunk driving were
encountered in some provinces, especially during the night, with a national
night time offence index of 2.3. Alcohol control should be stepped up and the
penalties should be severe.

e Barrier line offences. The huge contribution of this offence to the dangerous
situation on our roads should be recognised, with a national day time offence
index of 10.3.

e Smooth and damaged tyres. Serious problems with tyres of vehicles,
including trucks and taxis were found on the road, with a national worn tyre

67

--- Page 75 ---
index of 5.6. Reasons for serious deterioration of tyres and for the apparent
neglect of tyres by a large proportion of vehicle owners, professional drivers
and the freight and passenger transport industries should be investigated.

e Speeding. High levels of speeding offences were observed. The national
rural speed index for 2010 remains very high on 5.6. Speed discipline must
be restored on South African roads and community leaders on all levels
should set an example.

The Corporation’s Road Traffic Injuries and Research Network (RTIRN) has been
established.

The main objectives of the network are:

To set priorities for road traffic injury research.

To develop capacity for road traffic injury research

To promote investments

To facilitate communication between partners involved in road traffic injury
research

To conduct strategic research on road traffic injuries

To disseminate and promote the application and utilization of research result.

12. Traffic Engineering and Infrastructure Safety Audit

The Corporation has launched an international road assessment programme (IRAP).

The program’s main objective is to promote road safety through the improved road

infrastructure. The road network in which the project will be conducted is still to be

finalized in consultation with stakeholders. The project will help the country to reduce

fatal crashes that are caused due to road infrastructure. Such crashes are head-on,

brutal side-impacts at intersections, hitting roadside hazards, which kill vehicle

occupants. Pedestrians and bicyclists are killed when crossing road and when moving

along the road. These types of crashes could be reduced if road infrastructure is

addressed, as it is the main contributor. As the Corporation, we were able to solicit the

support of some of the key stakeholders.

68

--- Page 76 ---
The Corporation has also completed the road safety audit manual, which will help the
road authorities to identify hazardous locations and develop intervention and also use it

when planning new road infrastructure project.

ANNEXURE J

DEFINITION OF OFFENCES

For survey purposes, the different offences were defined as follows:
a. Speed offences

For the calculation of the indicators and indexes the offence rates excluding the tolerance
were used. The speed limits for all vehicles are the same in the 60 km/h zones. In the
higher speed zones, goods vehicles weighing more than 3 500 kg are restricted to 80
km/h; while buses and minibus taxis are restricted to 100 km/h in zones with a higher
general speed limit.

b. Alcohol levels

In respect of drivers of light motor vehicles, the legal limit of 0.24 mgjlitre of breath were
applied. Professional drivers as defined (i.e. drivers needing a Professional Driver Permit)
were tested on a level of 0.1 mg/l.

c. Seatbelts and Child Restraints

The survey recorded the wearing of seatbelts by drivers and passengers of Light Motor
Vehicles only. The observations of the drivers and front passengers were made at traffic
signals in urban areas, without the occupants being aware that they wearing of seatbelts
were being checked (unobserved). The wearing of seatbelts by back passengers, and the
use of child restraints were recorded during the roadblock surveys (observed).

a. Traffic signals

Where vehicles passed the stop line after the signal controlling their movement turned red,
it was recorded as an offence. However, where vehicles turned right in the face of the red
light after waiting for oncoming traffic during the green or amber phases, the movement
was not recorded as an offence if the front wheels were already over the stop line when

the light turned red.

b. Barrier lines

Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — Year 2010/11

In the survey of barrier line offences, an offence was recorded when any wheel or wheels
of a vehicle crossed the barrier line. Only convoys of vehicles were recorded, thus only
recording data where the driver of the vehicle was following another vehicle, and where
there was an opportunity to commit an offence.

c. Driver documentation

It was recorded as an offence when a driver could not produce a valid driver's licence for
the relevant vehicle type. Learners’ licences, temporary licences and valid international
licences were recorded separately. PrDPs appear as an inscription on the card licence.
The presence of the PrDP inscriptions on the licences of the drivers of the relevant
vehicles (goods vehicles with GVM exceeding 3,500 kg, public transport vehicles) was
recorded. If a permit was present but expired, it was recorded as a separate category of
offence.

d. Vehicle documentation

Agreement between the registration number on the number plate and the licence disk was
checked. In some cases the letters on the licence disk were illegible and this was recorded
separately. The correlation between the number plate and license disk was also checked.

e. Vehicle fitness

Tyres and lights were covered in this part of the survey. Tyres were recorded as illegal if
the treads on a part of more than +5cm x 5 cm, or a strip of more than +10cm x 1.5 cm,
was worn to less than 1 mm in depth. Tread depth meters were used for the purpose of
the survey. As far as damage to tyres was concerned, small dents that would clearly not
influence the strength of the tyre were ignored. Any damage (tears, cuts, holes) that the
surveyors felt uncomfortable about was recorded as an offence. A subjective element
could not be avoided.

Six categories of lights were tested: indicators front and back, head lights dim, head lights
bright, tail lights and brake lights. The number working was recorded. An offence was
recorded when any of those lights did not function.

f. Pedestrian Compliance with Traffic Signals
Pedestrian compliance with traffic signals was observed in urban areas at traffic signals
(robots) where pedestrian signals were present. The number of pedestrians arriving on the

red man, vs. the number of pedestrians crossing the red man was recorded.

g. Use of cell phones while driving
Drivers of vehicles talking on cell phones were observed at traffic signals (robots) in urban

areas. If the driver of a vehicle was using a cell phone while passing through, or stopping
at a traffic signal, it was recorded as an offence.

ANNEXURE K:
STRATEGY FOR SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION

The determination of sample sizes for a survey is often a complicated issue and various factors
need to be taken into account. These factors include:
¢ The nature of the relevant parameter to be estimated, which could be the mean, a
proportion, etc
¢ The statistical properties of the associated estimators of the parameters
¢ The amount of previous knowledge available.
* Specifications for the survey in terms of accuracy, confidence level, etc.

In addition to the above, in planning phases of the previous surveys some decisions on sampling
strategy had to be taken, like where to sample, which environmental / traffic conditions need to be
taken into account. etc. With all these factors in mind. certain recommended sample sizes were
proposed and implemented in the surveys.

At the end of the 2003 survey the standard errors of estimation were evaluated using a simulation
process. This process quantified the observed standard errors relative to standard errors of other
usually smaller sample sizes.

Based on the experience and knowledge gained during the previous survey (2002 to date), it was
possible to introduce some refinements in the sampling strategy.

The results of the evaluation of the initial sampling strategy are shown in the tables in the rest of
this chapter.

In the evaluation of the sampling strategy the actual results of previous surveys were taken into
account. By using the more detailed information from the previous surveys, it was possible to make
more accurate estimates of the “required” sample sizes. However, the “required” sample sizes
were not always practical, considering the realities out on the road. One example of such a
situation is where the theoretical “required” sample size for light motor vehicles is much smaller
than the samples that were normally taken in the past. Taking the practical situation into account, it
turns out that smaller samples for light motor vehicles will not really be less expensive because the
survey teams will still have to stay out on the road waiting for the other scarcer vehicle types to
appear (taxis, trucks and especially buses). On the other hand, the required sample sizes that are
based on an ideal combination of confidence interval and maximum error will be unpractical (read
“too expensive’) in the case of some of the scarcer vehicle categories on certain roads and during
certain times of the day (e.g. buses on rural roads during night time). In such cases it is necessary
to lower the standards - in some cases it will be necessary to use much less stringent requirements
than those implied by the “required” sample size.

The proposals on the “practical” sample sizes on the next couple of pages have been prepared,
taking the relevant issues (statistical requirements, realities on the road and typical cost structures)
into account. In most cases the original standards that were set by the Corporation are met and
even exceeded with these “practical” sample sizes. There are however some of the “practical”
sample sizes where the standards have been lowered substantially — in most cases this is related
to the scarcer vehicle types, especially during times of the day when very low volumes of these
vehicles are expected.

A new strategy to determine sample sizes for barrier line offences was introduced during the 2008
survey. The number of convoys of vehicles were recorded, with the convoys where barrier lines
were crossed being recorded as an offence.

The proposal on the “practical” sample sizes to be used during future surveys are shown in the rest
of this section.
