1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT
This report aims at achieving the following objectives:

e¢ To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced
vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period
January to March 2019. The performance is as provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 2 639 fatalities were recorded for the period between
January - March 2019 from 2 204 fatal crashes. As a result, there was a
decrease of 12% on fatalities from 2 983 fatalities during quarter 4 of 2018 to
2 639 fatalities during quarter 4 of 2019. The most affected road user group
during 2019 remains to be the pedestrians. However, passengers recorded a
slight decrease of 1% from 33% in 2018 to 32% in 2019.

A total number of nineteen (19) major crashes were reported and investigated
for the period under review. One-hundred and twenty-nine (129) persons were
killed and one-hundred and nine (109) persons sustained injuries in these

major crashes.
Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 248 354 (2.02%) from 12 293
212 on 31 March 2018 to 12 541 566 vehicles on 31 March 2019.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 16 952 (1.43%)
from 1 189 025 on 31 March 2018 to 1 172 073 on 31 March 2019.

--- Page 9 ---
pe Bt 3

The number of driving licences issued increased by 487 115 (3.84%) from
12 686 988 on 31 March 2018 to 13 174 103 as of 31 March 2019.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued decreased by 2 000
(0.18%) from 1 087 588 on 31 March 2018 to 1 085 588 on 31 March 2019.

SECTION A
1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between January and March of 2018 and 2019 using the
CHoCOR Form. In addition, the report includes information about registered
vehicles, un-roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and
professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic Information
System (NaTIS), Law Enforcement and Road Safety information. Furthermore,
it includes information about population growth using the 2018 mid-year
population estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1. +Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the
Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

--- Page 11 ---
Tage Jetic
2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical
report. There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation

purpose.

2.4 ~~ Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to
collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which encompasses the
number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality information per
road user group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. There was a decrease
of 198 (8%) crashes in comparison to quarter 4 of 2018 and 2019. Five provinces
recorded decreases and four provinces recorded increases. The highest decrease was
recorded for Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal with 22% and 19%, respectively. The
province which recorded the highest increase was Free State with 21% followed by
Mpumalanga with 12%.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and light delivery vehicles with contributions of 45.7% and 20.5% respectively
during 2019. The vehicle type combi/Minibus contributed 8.8% in 2018 and
9.4% in 2019, which shows a decrease 0.6%. These vehicle types may
contribute to high number of fatalities for passengers.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows:
human factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that
are valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

14

--- Page 17 ---
Road Traffic

The fatal crashes for January to- March 2019 showed that human factors
contributed 88.1% to the occurrence of fatal crashes followed by roads and
environmental factors at 7% and vehicle factors with a contribution of 5%.
