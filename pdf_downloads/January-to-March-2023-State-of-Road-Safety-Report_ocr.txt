1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report aims at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms and provincial
inputs; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced

vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

--- Page 7 ---
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period

January to March 2023. The performance is as provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 2 498 fatalities were recorded for the period January - March
2023 from 2 132 fatal crashes. A decrease of 10.16% has been recorded for

fatal crashes and 12.5% decrease in fatalities.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles decreased by 10 161 (0.08%) from 13 033
995 on 31 March 2022 to 13 023 834 vehicles as on the 31 March 2023.

The number of learner driving licenses issued decreased by 11 075 (1.0%)
from 1 102 285 end March 2022 to 1 091 210 end March 2023.

The number of driving licenses issued increased by 476 135 (3,27%) from
14 538 687 on 31 March 2022 to 15 014 802 as of 31 March 2023.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued increased by 194
098 (20.78%) from 933 894 on 31 March 2022 to 1127992 on 31 March
2023.

--- Page 8 ---
SECTION A

1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between January and March of 2022 and 2023 using the
CHoCOR Forms and input from provinces. In addition, the report includes
information about registered vehicles, learner driving licence, driving licence
and professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic Information
System (NaTIS).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations and takes
input from provinces. Road Traffic Management Corporation captures,

processes, and verifies the data to compile a report.

--- Page 9 ---
2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the
Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone. Input is also given by

provinces on fatal crashes and fatalities.
2.3 Data processing

The data is captured, verified and the consolidated statistics are compiled.

There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which
encompasses the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality information per road user group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below is a comparison between the fourth quarter of financial year
2021/22 and fourth quarter of financial year 2022/23. A decrease of 241
(10.2%) has been recorded for the periods under review. With exception of
Kwa-Zulu Natal (at 3.37% increase) other provinces recorded a decrease in
fatal crashes. The highest percentage decreases are North-West 25.14%, Free
State 25.00% and Eastern Cape at 17.15%.

human factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that
are valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road
and weather conditions).
