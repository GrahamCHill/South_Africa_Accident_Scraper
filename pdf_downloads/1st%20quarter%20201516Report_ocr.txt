(Data sourced from the RTMC Major Crash Investigation Statistical Database and Investigation Reports)

Contributing factors from vehicles were identified where the vehicles tires burst prior to the
crash, resulting in the driver losing control of the vehicle (4 crashes) and 2 crashes

occurred as a result of faulty steering wheels.

Contributing factors can be attributed to road and environmental factors where in 3

crashes poor visibility contributed to the crashes occurring and in 1 crash a driver swerved
out for stray animals on the road, losing control of the vehicle and colliding with another

vehicle.
