Measuring Progress towards Achieving Target to Reduce Fatalities by 50%
by 2015

Based on the 2006 Millennium Development Goals, one of the goals of the 2015
Road Traffic Safety Management Plan is to reduce by half the rate of accident
fatalities arising from road and other transport by 2015. In the development of the
2015 Plan it was agreed that the number of fatalities for the year 2007 would be
used as the benchmark on which the 50% reduction would be based. Using this
benchmark and the 50% target reduction, the maximum allowable number of road
fatalities per quarter per province up to the end of 2015 was calculated as
continuous reduced target figures over the 8 year period. These set targets for the
indicated quarters for each province and the RSA total, are shown in the table
below, shown as “Target” figures or maximum allowable number of fatalities.

The difference; as well as the percentage difference figures in the table shows the
difference between the set Target and Actual number of road fatalities. A
difference of “O” indicates that the set target of reducing the number of fatalities

was met. Differences smaller than “0” (<0) shows achievements better than what
is expected or required and differences larger than’0” (>0) shows that the required
targets were not achieved and reflects inadequate performance towards reaching
the desired goal per quarter and ultimately the 2015 goal.

The % difference in meeting the set targets per province is also reflected in the

The information in the table and graph above shows that best performing provinces
well on track towards achieving the goal of reducing road fatalities by 50% by the year
2015, amongst others, are :

Gauteng : which is also continuously improving its performance from -8,22% in
September 2008 to -21,76% in September 2009;

Western Cape : although this province shows an increase of +4,26% in the 1“
quarter under review (September 2008), from the and quarter this province
improved its performance to -1,45% (December 2008) up to -11,97% in
September 2009;

Free State : managed a good and steady performance during the first 4
quarters ranging from -15,15% (September 2008) to -16,48% (June 2009); but
dropped back to -5,21% in September 2009;

The Northern Cape and Eastern Cape are performing reasonably well and
contribute towards the required national reduction of road fatalities, with the
Northern Cape making the biggest contribution in this regard. The Eastern
Cape is performing basically on the margin of 0%.

The provinces that are not performing as required, are the following:

KwaZulu-Natal : overall the worst performing province, with even a continuous
increase in the quarterly number of road fatalities that exceed the set quarterly
targets for the province — ranging from +8,71% in September 2008; +21,40% in

8

--- Page 9 ---
Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report — September 2009

March 2009 and +32,47% in September 2009. This province was the biggest
contributor to the RSA, on a national basis not achieving its set target towards
the end of the review period. In this regard KwaZulu-Natal basically nullifies the
contribution of Gauteng;

e Mpumalanga : started off on a positive basis during the analysis period with a
figure of -3,63% in September 2008. However, over the next 4 quarters this
province worsened from +10,94% in December 2008 to +17,14% in September
2009;

e Limpopo : made no contribution towards achieving the 2015 goals. Over the
review period the performance of this province worsened from +1,85% in
September 2008 to +21,19% in September 2009.

North West : is operating very much on the border-line with figures ranging from -
1,42% in September 2008 to +3,43% in September 2009, moving in a non-
contributory direction.

National - RSA : over the review period the national figures range from -1,34% in
September 2008 to +2,85% in September 2009. The 3 worst performing provinces
listed above, contributed to this non-achieving trend, with the biggest negative
influence from KwaZulu-Natal.

8. Discussion

The level of lawlessness in terms of un-roadworthy vehicles in most (eight) provinces still
a challenge. For the reporting period un-licenced vehicles has decreased compared to
the previous financial year. These may be seen as a major contributory factor to the
number of fatal crashes and fatalities.

Despite the increase in the number of un-roadworthy vehicles, the information in this
report clearly indicates a steady decrease in both national number of fatal crashes and
fatalities. The driver and pedestrian’s fatalities have decreased, however the passenger's
fatalities has increased. The increase on passenger's fatalities might be as a result of
non-wearing of seatbelts.

The information in this report clearly indicates that the fatal crashes during Saturday and
Sunday have decreased with exception of an increase on Friday.

9. Recommendation

In view of the above results; as well as the now fast approaching 2009/2010 Festive
Season, it is recommended that:

e All provinces should vigorously increase their respective road safety promotion
programmes and projects, with emphasis on increased law enforcement
activities which should concentrate of vehicle (lights, tyres, brakes, etc) and
driver fitness (driving licence, alcohol, seatbelts, etc) issues and general law
compliance issues (speed, overtaking, skipping red traffic signals and stop
signs, etc).

e Law enforcement activities should be fully supported by public awareness,
communication and educational programmes;

e Particular attention should be given to more proactive and effective road safety
promotion efforts in KwaZulu-Natal; Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West;
with emphasis on increased law enforcement activities; and

e In this regard the outcome of the 2008 Road Traffic Offence Survey should be
used as the basis for identification and addressing the most critical road traffic
offences.

Road traffic crash

A road traffic crash is an accident, event, collision or crash between two or
more vehicles, a vehicle and a train, a vehicle and a cyclist, a vehicle and
a pedestrian, a vehicle and an animal, a vehicle and a fixed object, such
as a bridge, building, tree, post, etc, or a single vehicle that overturned on
or near a public road. A road traffic crash is a single road traffic incident,
regardless of the number of vehicles or persons involved in any particular
crash. In short : a road crash happens when two road users, regardless of
mode of travel, try to occupy the same road space at the same time.

Crash categories

Categories or Degrees of Crashes : Road traffic crashes are classified in

the following four categories in accordance with the severity thereof :

« Fatal crash : a crash resulting in the death of one or more persons.
The persons killed may be drivers and passengers of vehicles, or
cyclists and pedestrians. Such crashes can include serious and slight
injuries.

« Major crash : a crash in which one or more persons are seriously
injured and can include slight injuries.

¢ Minor crash : a crash in which one or more persons are slightly
injured.

The above three categories of crashes are jointly referred to as casualty

crashes.

« Damage only crash : a crash in which no-one was killed or injured
and resulted in damage to the vehicle or vehicles and/or other property
only.

Casualty
categories

Categories or Degrees of Casualties : Road traffic casualties or injuries
are classified in the following three categories in accordance with the
severity thereof :

« Fatality : person or persons killed during or immediately after a crash,
or death within 6 days after a crash happened as a direct result of
such crash. (Also see item 17 below for international definition).

e Serious injury : person/s sustained injuries to such an extent that
hospitalisation is required. Serious injuries include fractures,
crushings, concussion, internal injuries, severe cuts and lacerations,
severe shock, etc which require medical treatment, hospitalisation
and/or confinement to bed.

¢ Slight injury : person/s sustained minor cuts and bruises, sprains and
light shock which may be treated at the scene of the crash or at home.

Crash rates

« Crash rate per the registered vehicle population : The crash rate
per 10 000 vehicle population is calculated by dividing the number of
crashes by the vehicle population, in ten thousands, of the relevant
region, province or country.

« Crash rate per distance or kilometres travelled by vehicles: The
crash rate per 100 million vehicle kilometres travelled is calculated by
dividing the number of crashes by the combined distance travelled by
all motorised vehicles, in hundred millions, within the relevant region,

Definition

province or country. The distance travelled is usually calculated in
terms of the number of the different types of vehicles, mean fuel
consumption per vehicle type and fuel sales for a particular period.

Casualty rates

« Severity of Fatal Crashes or Fatality Rate : is the mean (average)
number of persons killed per fatal accident. This rate refers to the
severity of fatal crashes - the more persons killed per fatal crash the
more severe the accident. More severe crashes are indicative of the
higher impact of such crashes, possibly resulting from higher speeds,
drivers and passengers not wearing seatbelts, or more vehicles
involved in single crashes (number of vehicles per crash), or more high
occupancy vehicles, such as buses and minibuses involved in
accidents.

« Casualty rate : the mean total number of casualties (deaths and
serious and slight injuries) per casualty crash.

¢ Fatality rate per human population : The fatality rate per 100 000
population is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the
population, in hundred thousands, of the relevant region, province or
country.

« Casualty rate per human population : Similar to the fatality rate, the
casualty rate per 100 000 population is calculated by dividing the total
number of casualties by the population, in hundred thousands, of the
relevant region, province or country.

« Fatality rate per vehicle population : The fatality rate per 10 000
vehicles is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the vehicle
population, in ten thousands, of the relevant region, province or
country.

« Casualty rate per vehicle population : The casualty rate per 10 000
vehicles is calculated by dividing the total number of casualties by the
vehicle population, in ten thousands, of the relevant region, province
or country.

« Fatality rate per distance travelled : The fatality rate per 100 million
vehicle kilometres (mvk) travelled is calculated by dividing the number
of fatalities by the distance travelled, in 100 mvk, of the relevant
region, province or country.

« Casualty rate per distance travelled : The casualty rate per 100
million vehicle kilometres (mvk) travelled is calculated by dividing the
total number of casualties by the distance travelled, in 100 mvk, of the
relevant region, province or country.

Trends

Trends are used to indicate increases or decreases in the number of
crashes, fatalities, casualties and rates. Trends are usually expressed in
terms of percentage (%) increase or decrease from the previous
corresponding period to the current period under consideration, usually
one year.

Equivalent
Accident Number
(EAN)

In order to identify and rank hazardous sections of road, or junctions of
roads, the various categories (or degrees of crashes - fatal, major, minor
and damage only) have to be weighted and added together for each
section of road between 2 known nodes, or junctions, to determine the
crash factor or Equivalent Accident Number (EAN) for each link or node.

Term

Definition

The weighting of crashes for the purpose of calculating the EAN is based
on the ratio between the costs of the various types of crashes (2008
figures) as shown in the table below. For example, the weight of a damage
only crash equals one (1); while the cost of major crash is 6,55 times
higher and that of a fatal crash 16,63 times.

Weighting of Crash Cost for EAN Calculations
Crash Type Cost R million Weight
Fatal 1,174,189} 16,63
Major 462,664 6,55
Minor 253,721 3,59
Damage 70,623] 1,00

Hazardous sections of road are rated in terms of EAN per 10km of road or
EAN per mvk travelled, if known for all the sections of road under
consideration for rating. The Severity Index (SI) per road link, for ranking
purposes, is the EAN divided by the total number of crashes for that link.
(SI = EAN / No. of crashes).

Number of
registered
vehicles

The number of registered vehicles is the number as registered on the
National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at 24:00 on the last
day of each month. This figure takes cognisance of the number of new or
re-registrations and the number of vehicle de-registrations during the
month. It should be noted that vehicles that were written-off because of a
crash, are not necessarily scrapped or de-registered during the same
month that the crash happened.

Un-Roadworthy
Vehicles

Un-roadworthy vehicles is defined as those of which the owners failed to
submit the vehicles for compulsory annual roadworthy tests (including
buses, minibus taxis and freight transport vehicles) or on change of
ownership.

The number of un-roadworthy vehicles is the number marked as un-
roadworthy on the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at
24:00 on the last day of each month.

10

Un-Licenced
Vehicles

Un-licenced vehicles are those of which the owners failed to renew the
vehicle licences within the 21 day grace period allowed.

The number of un-licenced vehicles is the number marked as un-licenced
on the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at 24:00 on the
last day of each month.

11

Learner Driving
Licences

Learner driving licences are categorised as follows:

* Category 1 : Motorcycle

e Category 2 : Light Motor Vehicle

« Category 3 : Heavy Motor Vehicle

The number of registered learner licences is the number as registered on
the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), usually at 24:00 on the
last day of each month. This figure takes cognisance of the number of new
registrations and the number of de-registrations (cancellations, which
include expired learner licences and licences becoming invalid because of
a driving licence obtained by the holder) during the month.

All fuel sales

The total fuel sales figures in terms of petrol and diesel sales in number of
litres sold per province per month, are obtained from SAPIA, and more
recently from Response Group Trendline (RGT — affiliated to NAAMSA) in
the order of about 6 weeks after the end of each particular month.

15

Fuel sales for
road use

The estimated fuel sales for road use is calculated in terms of the
recommendations contained in the CSIR research report CR-2002/79, in
accordance with which 98% of all petrol sales and 70% of all diesel sales
are for road usage.

(Note : CSIR report
CR-2002/79 was
produced in 2002
based on 2001 figures
and it is recommended
that, in view of
changes in this regard,
new research be done
in order to update the
figures)

The estimated distance travelled per type of vehicle per province per
month is calculated in terms of the recommendations contained in the
CSIR research report CR-2002/79 and based on the average number of
vehicles per fuel type (petrol and diesel) as registered on NaTIS and the
fuel sales per fuel type for road use for each particular month.

The percentage (%) allocation of the total estimated types of fuel for road
usage per type of vehicle (in accordance with CSIR research report CR-
