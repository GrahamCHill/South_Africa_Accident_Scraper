1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms and provincial
inputs; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced

vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report provides fatal road crash statistics in South African public roads.
The performance is for the period January to March 2024. The performance per

each focus areas have been provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total of 2 818 fatalities were recorded between January and March 2024
compared to 2 498 for the same period in 2023. For the same period 2 327
fatal crashes were recorded compared to 2 132 period in 2023. This is an
increase of 12.81% in fatalities and 9.15% fatal crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 171 959 (1.32%) from
13 023 834 in March 2023 to 13 195 793 vehicles in March 2024.

The number of learner driving licences issued increased by 11 247 (0.16%)
from 1 091 210 in March 2023 to 1 102 457 in March 2024.

The number of driving licences issued increased by 602 002 (4.01%) from
15 014 802 in March 2023 to 15 616 804 in March 2024.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued increased by
77 677 (6.89%) from 1 127 92 in March 2023 to 1 205 669 in March 2024.

SECTION A
. INTRODUCTION

This report compares fatal crashes reported to police stations between January
and March 2023 and January and March 2024 using the CHoCOR Forms and
information recorded by provinces. The report includes information on
registered vehicles, driving licences and professional driving permits issued
from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS); and information on
population growth using the 2023 mid-year population estimates from
Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
and Provincial Departments of Road and Transport are the sources of fatal
crash data. SAPS provides the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC)
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (called the CAS list) and further to this
the RTMC receives CHoCOR forms from various police stations; the provincial
departments also submit data on fatal crashes to RTMC. RTMC validates all
inputs for consistency, captures, processes, and verifies the data and compiles

the report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms and provincial inputs. The data is
then submitted to RTMC.

--- Page 9 ---
7

2.3. Data processing

The data is received from the three areas (SAPS, CHoCOR and provinces),
validated, captured, processed, and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with SAPS

and provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for collection of all road crashes, traffic
volumes, road conditions, weather reports amongst others to complement the

data currently collected.

2.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms and

provincial inputs are used by RTMC record fatality data on daily basis.

3. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers fatal road crash data. The section encompasses the number
of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality data per road user

group and major crashes.

3.1. Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between the fourth quarter of the
financial year 2022/23 and fourth quarter of the financial year 2023/24.
Nationally there has been an increase of 195(9.15%) fatal crashes. At a
provincial all provinces recorded increases in fatal crashes. Eastern Cape had
the highest numerical increase in fatal crashes of 39(17.18%) followed by
North West 36(27.48%) then Western Cape at 35(12.03%) and Mpumalanga
at 33(18.54%).

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users); vehicle factors (are focussed on the vehicle itself covering
issues around mechanical failures); and environment factors (include limited
visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road

infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road and weather conditions).

Human factors contribute a high percent to fatal crashes. Human factors
contributed 84.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023/2024 and 89.8% in the fourth
quarter of 2022/2023 to fatal crashes. Human factors in fatal crashes remain a

big concern.
