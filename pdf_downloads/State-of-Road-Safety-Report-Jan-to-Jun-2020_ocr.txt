1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The review of the State of Road Safety in South Africa over the last six months
is split into two, from January to March and from April to June. This is due to the
National wide COVID-19 lockdown that took effect from 27 March 2020. This is
because almost all economic activities were halted to reduce the impact of the
pandemic and as such, the road traffic environment saw significantly reduced

volumes on South African roads.

Furthermore, additional regulations which positively affected safety on South
African roads, notably, the ban of consumable alcohol and night-time driving. As
such, quarter on quarter road crash fatalities reduced by 61%. This was further
demonstrated by an 80% reduction in Easter fatalities in April due to limited
movements and no social gatherings; however, key patterns indicated the abuse

of the emptier space on the road which is linked to road user behaviour.

The country continues to battle with drink driving and the lockdown months
provided a limited impact review of alcohol not only on South African roads but
as well as the medical fraternity. The bill to propose zero alcohol limits is

currently in Parliament, with comments from the public being accepted.

Majority of the Road Safety programmes were halted in a number of provinces
between April and June 2020 - due to restrictions in travel and interpersonal
engagement. This extended to non-achievement of provincial KPIs linked to the
transportation of school-going children and additional restrictions when the
Department of Education implemented a risk-adjusted strategy for Grades 7 and
12.

Whilst the Corporation, DOT SOEs and provincial Road Safety Education units
adopted the use of technology to drive road safety messages; however, the key

focus during the quarter was on COVID-19. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 30 June 2020 1

--- Page 8 ---
this mode of engagement is limited in a country which is a hybrid of the First
and Third world.

The implementation of the National Road Safety Strategy remains a priority in
the country; however, the key challenge is the adoption of a Safe Systems
approach. Key challenges are inherently tough to change in South Africa an
amongst these, are the rise of information settlements next to major freeways,
poor town planning which does not prioritise non-motorised transport and
limited action towards more safer vehicles in South Africa. The 2019 AA Vehicle
Safety Report provides an indication of poor consumer knowledge on vehicle
safety matters and a proactive interest ‘sporty’ aspect of a vehicle during

purchase and not safety.

Pedestrians remain the most vulnerable road user on South African roads,
accounting for more than 35% of the fatalities. Whilst this figure is much higher
for Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and Western Cape - key efforts are required to (1)
educate the road user more intensively and (2) provide protection to these road
users through engineering infrastructure. This remains a challenge in a country
or province which still has to prioritise the elimination of gravel road in key parts

of the country. This does also provide an opportunity to build safer roads.

2 INTRODUCTION

This report aims to provide an overview of the state of road safety in South
Africa between January and June 2020. the Road Traffic Management
Corporation is mandated by the Road Traffic Management Corporation Act, No.

20 of 1999 to report on road crashes in South Africa.

Over the last five years, South Africa has seen a decline in the number of road
crash fatalities; however, the reduction has not been significant to meet the
2010 - 2020 Decade of Action goals nor has the rate of reduction indicated that
the 2016 - 2030 National Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) targets will be met.

2.1 NRSS TARGET

The NRSS 2016-2030 sets the target of reducing fatalities in the country by 50
% from 13,967 fatalities that was recorded in 2010 by 2030. The graph below
depicts an initial smaller annual target from 2017 to 2021 whereafter a larger
linear annual decrease is set until 2030 to allow for the implementation of initial
NRSS interventions. The actual recorded fatalities for 2018 and 2019 are below
the targets set respectively with preliminary data predicting a further reduction

in fatalities for 2020. Once traction is gathered with the implementation of the

initial NRSS interventions, the targets will be aligned to the actual recorded
fatalities and new target set for the remaining years; it is envisaged that this

will be done with the commencement of the 2021/22 financial year.

So stated the NRSS 2016-2030, a reduction in serious injuries of equal amount
would also be considered a strategic target, however current data limitations
make measuring this progress difficult. Improving and addressing information
shortcomings such as collecting data on road crash injuries has therefore also

been identified as a strategic theme of this strategy.

and this report is structured to provide an update, challenges, and planned

interventions within that focus area.

2.2 METHODOLOGIES AND DATA LIMITATION

2.2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation with
a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the Corporation
receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic
Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to compile a

report.

2.2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the

Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

2.2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical

report. There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

2.2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to collect

scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

3 ROAD SAFETY COLLECTION METHODOLOGY

3.1 BACKGROUND

In previous editions of the State of Road Safety reports, the RTMC focused on
the road crash information, with the key Road Safety initiatives, Law
Enforcement interventions and progress on the implementation of the NRSS not
being consolidated into a single report. This led to limited engagements on the
overall interventions that the South African road safety stakeholders are

implementing, and alignment across all interventions.

Moreover, countries with similar road safety challenges have elevated the matter
of road safety and amongst others, these countries publish comprehensive
annual State of Road Safety reports with an objective to drive the road safety

agenda at the highest level possible.

However, key challenges remain a hindrance in the South African context

including:

e Limited data collection and information processing to understand macro and
micro societal factors affecting the set targets in road safety;

e The various platforms that exist in the fraternity, noting that multiple
stakeholders are interlinked with Road Safety in South Africa including and
not limited to the South Africa Police Service, provincial and_ local
government, non-governmental agencies and the private sector - each
pursuing its priority activities aligned to their mandate;

e The inherent corruption associated with the road traffic fraternity, which
extends from the acquisition of a driver’s license to road traffic law
transgressions and limited implications thereafter;

e Road user behaviour remains a challenge in the country including:

o Driving at an inappropriately high speeds in certain sections of the road;
o Driving under the influence of alcohol; and

o Distracted driving notably, the use of a mobile phone whilst driving.

4 STRUCTURE AND CULTURE

4.1 CHARACTERISTICS

South Africa, the southernmost country on the African continent, renowned for
its varied topography, great natural beauty, and cultural diversity, all of which
have made the country a favoured destination for travellers since the dawn of
democracy in 1994. The vast majority of black South Africans were not
enfranchised until 1994.

Africa is a developing country and ranks 113th on the Human Development
Index, the seventh highest in Africa. It has been classified by the World Bank as
a newly industrialized country, with the second-largest_economy in Africa, and
the 33rd-largest in the world. South Africa also has the most UNESCO World
Heritage Sites in Africa. The country is a middle power in international affairs; it

maintains significant regional influence and is a member of the G20.

Today South Africa enjoys a relatively stable mixed economy that draws on its
fertile agricultural lands, abundant mineral resources, tourist attractions, and
highly evolved intellectual capital. Greater political equality and economic
stability, however, do not necessarily mean social tranquillity. South African
society at the start of the 21st century continued to face steep challenges: rising
crime rates, ethnic tensions, great disparities in housing and educational

opportunities, and the AIDS pandemic.

South Africa is bordered by Namibia to the northwest, by Botswana and
Zimbabwe to the north, and by Mozambique and Swaziland to the northeast and
east. Lesotho, an independent country, is an enclave in the eastern part of the
republic, surrounded by South African territory. South Africa’s coastlines border

the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest.

4.2. POPULATION

According to Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), the midyear population of South
Africa has increased to an estimated 59,62 million in 2020. The population of
Gauteng is approximately 15,5 million (26,0%), the province with the highest
portion of the county’s population. KwaZulu-Natal follows with the second
highest portion of the population with 11,5 million people with the Northern Cape
province having the smallest portion of the population at only 1,29 million. Stats
SA further estimates that the female population is an estimated 30,5 million

females (51,1%) of the total population.

In addition, about 28,6% of the population is aged younger than 15 years and
approximately 9,1% (5,4 million) is 60 years or older. Of those younger than 15
years of age, the majority reside in KwaZulu-Natal (21,8%) and Gauteng
(21,4%). Of the elderly (those aged 60 years and older), the highest percentage
24,1% (1,31 million) reside in Gauteng. The proportion of elderly persons aged
60 and has grown from 7,6% in 2002 to 9,1% in 2020 (Stats SA, Mid-Year 2020
Report).

4.3. CLIMATE

South Africa’s long coastline - some 2,800 kilometres — influences much of the
climate. On the west coast is the cold Atlantic Ocean, and the warmer Indian
Ocean on the south and east. Starting at the hot and arid desert border with
Namibia in the northwest, South Africa’s coastline runs south down the cold
Skeleton Coast, around the Cape Peninsula to Cape Agulhas. This is the
southernmost tip of Africa, said to be where the Atlantic and Indian oceans meet.
In fact, it is here, slightly offshore, that two coastal currents meet, currents that
determine the different coastal climates. The cold Benguela current sweeps the

west coast, and the warm Agulhas current the east.

Figure 3: South African climate

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 30 June 2020 9

--- Page 16 ---
From Cape Agulhas the coastline moves east and slowly northwards, and the

climate becomes warmer and wetter. The Western Cape’s pretty green Garden
Route gives way to the forested Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape, and then humid
subtropical KwaZulu-Natal coast, famous for its beaches. In the northeast, the

coast reaches the border of Mozambique.

Running along most of the coast is a narrow low-lying strip of land, which soon
gives way to a higher plateau - the Great Escarpment. The high altitude of South
Africa’s interior means the country is generally much cooler than southern

hemisphere countries at the same latitude, such as Australia.

4.4 ROAD NETWORK

The South African Road Network consists of approximately 750,000 km of road
and is estimated to be the tenth largest road network in the world. The following
table illustrates the breakdown of the road network of road authorities within

the country.

4.6 STRUCTURE OF ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT

The National Department of Transport is responsible for the policy and legislation
governing roads and public transport. This is implemented through provincial
departments, local government and public entities. In terms of Schedule 5 of
the Constitution, provincial roads and traffic are an exclusive provincial function,
while municipal roads, traffic and parking are exclusive Schedule 5B municipal
functions. Public transport is a concurrent Schedule 4A function of both national
and provincial government. While municipal public transport is a Schedule 4B

concurrent municipal function.

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 30 June 2020 13

--- Page 20 ---
The strategy of the DoT has been guided by five strategic priorities that define

the work of the Department and the political agenda over the term of this

administration. The following key five (5) priorities have been identified which

will guide the effort of the sector:

Safety as an enabler of service delivery;

Public transport that enables social emancipation and an economy

that works;

Infrastructure build that stimulates economic growth and job

creation;

Building a maritime nation, elevating the oceans economy; and

Accelerating transformation towards greater economic participation

6 ROAD SAFETY RESEARCH

The RTMC, in collaboration with the SAMRC-UNISA Violence, Injury and Peace
Research Unit (VIPRU) has investigated the role of driver alcohol intoxication as
a risk factor for fatal road traffic crashes in the country for the period 2016-
2018. The research is based on the analysis of data collected by the RTMC and
included records of 13 074 fatal crashes with known driver risk factors and was
published by the RTMC in March 2020.

Extrapolating from RTMC data and other research nationally, driver alcohol
intoxication is believed to account for 27.1% of fatal crashes in the country
where driver error is the primary attribution; with an associated estimated cost

of R 18.2 billion. This is considerably higher than current estimates.

Given evidence globally to indicate that driver error may be involved in over
90% of all fatal crashes, it is possible that driver alcohol intoxication is implicated

in at least one in four of all fatal crashes in the country, regardless of cause.

Reference:

Other research published in March 2020, in line with the Safe System Approach
towards providing more forgiving roads in the country are a literature review on
speed and speed limits in SA, as Phase A of the improved driver behaviour
project and research on the effect of outdoor advertising on road safety and a

draft safety engineering manual for outdoor advertising in South Africa.

PERFORMANCE ON NATIONAL ROAD SAFETY
STRATEGY

The implementation of the National Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) 2016-2030 is

driven by the 82 outlined initiatives. With each of these initiatives aligned to the

five pillars of the Decade of Action for Road Safety, they are led by various

agencies viz.

Pillar 1:

Pillar 2:
Pillar 3:

Pillar 4:

Pillar 5:

Road Safety Management - RTMC and the Department of
Transport (DOT)

Safer Roads - SANRAL and Provincial Authorities

Safer Vehicles - The Department of Trade and Industry (and
its agencies namely, the National Regulator for Compulsory
Specification (NRCS), South African Bureau of Standards
(SABS)

Safer Road User - RTMC and DOT SOEs with the Road Safety
mandate

Post Crash Care - Department of Health and the Road
Accident Fund (RAF)

This section aims to provide an update on the 82 initiatives outlined in the NRSS,

noting that; the finalisation of a coherent implementation plan and the cost of

implementing the NRSS is still outstanding. The approach to address this

shortcoming is addressed in Annexure A of this report.

7.6 SUMMARY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

The table below is derived from the summation of quarterly performance reports

of the Roads Entities and Provincial Departments of Transport.

The Stakeholders implements interventions without a nationally developed
implementation plan, within limited budgetary costs and when funds are

permitting.

71% of the interventions are being implemented and 29% still pending
implementation and 73% of the Short Term and 67% of the Medium-Term

interventions are being implemented.

7.7 CHALLENGES TO DATE

Over the last two years, the Corporation has been reporting on NRSS based on

information published in the quarterly performance reports of the stakeholders.

Whilst this indicated that efforts made by various stakeholders to

implementation the initiatives, the overall conclusion was that:

e The efforts were not coordinated and provide the best chance of

success;

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 30 June 2020 30

--- Page 37 ---
e There was a limited opportunity to fairly evaluate the impact if these

were not coordinated optimally; and
e There was a limited opportunity to solicit external funding if the costs

were unknown.

The work undertaken by the Corporation in 2017/18 began to pave uniformity
in the implementation of the NRSS; however, systematic constraints led to

disruptions in the process such as:

e The then strategic programmes were not amended to integrate
NRSS-linked initiatives, and this led to the NRSS being considered
to be additional work without additional funding in the current
MTEF budget cycle;

e Unsigned off performance achievements linked to the NRSS by Ac-
counting Officers were not auditable and thus systematically, they
were equivalent to additional voluntary performance information;
and

e The above-mentioned challenge led to provinces reverting to Annual
Performance Plan targets (including transversal indicators) —- which
were consolidated for the RTMC and the DOT. In certain cases,
NRSS-linked work was kept at an operational level which other

simply dropped it.

The above-mentioned challenges are however; addressed in the revised
approach in the engagement of stakeholders as presented in the attached

Annexure.

8 EFFECT OF COVID-19 ON ROAD SAFETY

An analysis to evaluate the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown periods were
conducted between the period from 1 January to 30 June for 2019 and 2020.
The number of fatal crashes for each period were superimposed on an extraction
of traffic flow on SANRAL Roads for the periods in concern. It needs to be noted
that the traffic flow used in the analysis is only a small extract of 72 counting
stations at toll gates and did not include an urban sample. The following graph

depicts the analysis outcome:

2019 vs 2020 Traffic Flow Trend & Fatal Crashes Lockdown L5 Lockdown L4 Lockdown L3
24 Mar 20 - 30Apr20 1May 20-31 1Jun 20-30Jun

fm 2019_Flow 2020_Flow mmm Easter 2020 mmmEaster 2019 ——2020_FatCr —~2019_FatCr

Figure 7: Effect of Covid-19 on fatal crashes

It is clear from the above graph, that the traffic flow for the two periods followed
very much the same trend with a drastic drop in vehicle flow on 24 March 2020

when the Level-5 lockdown commenced.

The number of fatal crashes during the same periods also followed very much
the same trend with the same drastic decrease in fatal crashes from 25 March
2020. It could be argued that less vehicles on the road contributed to less fatal
crashes due to less points of conflict due to amongst others poor driving

behaviour and pedestrian activity when the lockdown started.

It is unfortunate to note that with the relaxation of the lockdown levels from
Level-5 to Level-4 and Level-3, that the number of fatal crashes followed the

same upward trend with the increase of vehicle flow.

State of road safety report: 1 Jan 2020 - 30 June 2020 32

9 ROAD SAFETY OUTCOMES

During the reporting period, 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020 a total number of
3,331 fatal crashes were recorded. This is a reduction in fatal crashes of 31,8%
from the same period in 2019 when 4 887 fatal crashes were recorded. The large
reduction in fatal crashes is directly related to the Covid-19 restriction of vehicle

and people movement from 24 March 2020 to 30 June 2020.

notwithstanding that there was a reduction in fatalities of more than 30%,

illustrated in the figure below.

The trend continues with the largest proportion of fatalities within the age group

Figure 12: Percentage distribution of fatalities per age group

No significant change was recorded in the gender split for fatalities during the
analysis period with males that died being three quarters of all fatalities or
75,3% for 2020. Driver’s license card holders registered on the NaTIS System
constitutes a 61,1/38,9 per cent male/female split; it could thus be argued that

more males are killed as drivers in context of licenced female drivers.

Figure 17: Percentage distribution of fatalities per contributory factors

From the figure above, the top five contributory factors were reported as being
human factors with the highest Vehicle Factor (No.5 on above figure) i.e., Tyres
burst prior to crash at 3,9% in 2020. The top Road and Environmental factor

were reported as being Sharp Bend at 2,9% in 2020.

Even though the rest of the contributory factors reported were less than 1% of

all contributory factors, does diminish its significance.

10 PEDESTRIAN SAFETY

10.1 PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES

Pedestrian safety remains the most significant road safety problem in South
Africa with 41,4% of all fatalities recorded during the period of analysis and
almost the same as the 2019 % of 41,6% illustrated in the table below. This is
almost 13 percentage points higher than the annual recorded pedestrian

fatalities of an average of 38% over the past few years.

Pedestrian deaths are 33,9% lower than the same recorded for 2019 due to the

restriction of people and vehicle movement from March 2020 to June 2020.

From the figure above, the most pedestrian crashes, or crashes where
pedestrians were killed in of total fatal crashes in the respective province, were
reported in the KwaZulu-Natal, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces with
more than 50% of the respective fatal crashes involving pedestrian deaths.

Nationally, 47.3% of all fatal crashes record pedestrian fatalities.

The figure below depicts the pedestrian deaths per province during the period
analysed. In line with the recorded fatal pedestrian crashes above, Gauteng and
the Western Cape provinces have the highest pedestrian deaths with more than
50% recorded in the two provinces. The province with the lowest number of
pedestrian deaths is the Limpopo province followed closely by the Northern Cape

province.

11 COST OF CRASHES

The high number of road traffic crashes and their associated consequences has a
significant impact on South African society, which in turn continues to hamper socio-
economic development and affects the well-being of all South Africans. This impact is
measured in terms of human lives lost, “pain, grief and suffering”, as well as an
increasing cost to the economy. In 2019, the total cost of road crashes amounted to an
estimated R170.60 billion; adjusted with CPI and crash statistics from the calculated
R142.95 billion for 2015 - Published September 2016 (see following graph and link):
