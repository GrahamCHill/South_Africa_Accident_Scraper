1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report aims at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms and provincial
inputs; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced

vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

--- Page 8 ---
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period

January to March 2022. The performance is as provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 2 855 fatalities were recorded for the period January - March
2022 from 2 373 fatal crashes. An increase of 10% has been recorded for fatal

crashes and 12% increase for fatalities.

A total number of twenty-eight (28) major crashes were reported and
investigated for the period under review. One-hundred and eighty-seven (187)
people were killed, and one hundred and thirty-six (136) victims sustained
injuries from the major crashes. In total, all the above amount to three

hundred and twenty-three casualties.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 286 210 (2,25%) from 12 747
784 on 31 March 2021 to 13 033 994 vehicles as on the 31 March 2022.

The number of learner driving licences issued increased by 177 115 (19,14%)
from 925 170 on 31 March 2021 to 1 102 285 on 31 March 2022.

--- Page 9 ---
The number of driving licences issued increased by 503 261 (3,59%) from
14 035 426 on 31 March 2021 to 14 538 687 as of 31 March 2022.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued decreased by 262
296 (21,93%) from 1196 190 on 31 March 2021 to 933 894 on 31 March
2022.

--- Page 10 ---
SECTION A

1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between January and March of 2021 and 2022 using the
CHoCOR Forms and input from provinces. In addition, the report includes
information about registered vehicles, learner driving licence, driving licence
and professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic Information
System (NaTIS).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations and takes
input from provinces. Road Traffic Management Corporation captures,

processes, and verifies the data to compile a report.

--- Page 11 ---
2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the
Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone. Input is also given by

provinces on fatal crashes and fatalities.
2.3 Data processing

The data is captured, verified and the consolidated statistics are compiled.

There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which
encompasses the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality information per road user group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between the fourth quarter of financial
year 2020/21 and fourth quarter of financial year 2021/22. An increase of 218
(10%) has been recorded for the periods under review. With exception of
Eastern Cape, Free State and Mpumalanga the other provinces recorded an
increase in fatal crashes. The highest percentage increases are Northern Cape
at 38%, North West at 22% and Gauteng at 21%.

The Figure above indicates the percentage distribution per province of fatal
crashes for the two quarters. The highest contributors to fatal crashes during
quarter four of financial year 2021/22 in percentage are Gauteng at 22%,
Kwa-Zulu Natal at 18%, Western Cape at 13% and Eastern Cape at 12%.

3.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the fatal crashes per day of the week is given in the table below.
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the days of the week with most fatal crashes
recorded compared to other days. About 59% of fatal crashes were recorded
for the three days for 2021 whilst about 58% were recorded for the same days
in 2022.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows:
human factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that
are valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

5. MAJOR CRASHES

This section provides for all the major crashes for the period under review.
Major crashes are defined as Crashes where five (5) or more people died,
crashes involving vehicles carrying dangerous goods / hazardous chemicals
where there is a fatality and a spillage of the dangerous goods / hazardous
chemicals, high profile person and any crash that the Corporation deems

necessary to investigate.
