DATA MANAGEMENT
Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is the
primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS provides the Corporation with a list
of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the Corporation receive
the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road Traffic Management
Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data in order to compile a report.

Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are submitted to the

Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.
Data processing

Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) captures, processes and verifies all
the data received and captured in order to compile a consolidate report. There is a

continuous engagement with provinces for validation purpose.

* Road Traffic Management Corporation Road Traffic Report: April - June 2016

. Driving at a speed too high for circumstances
. Driving while intoxicated with drugs/ liquor

. Driving in the wrong lane

. Driving in wrong lane/ oncoming traffic lane

. Turning in the face of oncoming traffic

. Overtaking in the face of oncoming traffic

13.5% of the contributing factors to the major crashes that occurred during the first quarter
of the 2016/ 2017 financial year were attributed to Vehicle Error. These crashes occurred

as a result of the following:

. Faulty brakes on the vehicle

7. Conclusion

There were 2 912 fatal crashes recorded during the period under review with 3 451
fatalities. Fatalities for pedestrians contributed 41% followed by passenger's
contribution of 31%. The information depicts that of the total number of fatalities
there were 76% representing fatalities for males during the crashes and 23% for
females. Most of crashes occurred between 14:00 to 22:00 with a contribution of
52%. Most vehicles involved in the crashes were motorcars and LDV with 48% and
20% respectively. Furthermore, most crashes occurred as a result of human

factors.

There were 37 major crashes reported and investigated during this period where
154 persons were killed and 179 sustained injuries in the crashes. Out of 37 major

crashes, 86% were as a results of human factors while 14% were vehicle factors.

There is a need to strengthen the Law Enforcement operations to address among
others the vehicle roadworthiness and passenger's safety. The information shows
that more road users that are vanishing are the passengers and pedestrians. The
Road Safety initiatives must focus on the safety of the above mentioned two road

users not neglecting drivers.
