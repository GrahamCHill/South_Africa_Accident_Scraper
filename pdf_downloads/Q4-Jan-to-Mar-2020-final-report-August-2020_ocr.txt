1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report aims at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide final road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced

vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

--- Page 8 ---
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of the report is to provide final road crash statistics for the period

January to March 2020. The performance is as provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 2 545 fatalities were recorded for the period between
January to March 2020 from 2 146 fatal crashes. As a result, there was a
decrease of 4% with regards to fatalities from 2 639 fatalities during quarter 4
of 2019 to 2 545 fatalities during quarter 4 of 2020. The most affected road
user group during 2020 remains to be the pedestrians. However, passengers
recorded a slight decrease of 3% from 31% to 28%.

A total number of twenty-seven (27) major crashes were reported and
investigated for the period under review. One-hundred and eighty-eight (188)
persons were killed and two-hundred and fourteen (214) persons sustained

injuries in these major crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 212 982 (1.70%) from 12 541
566 on 31 March 2019 to 12 754 548 vehicles on 31 March 2020.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 12 707 (1.08%)
from 1 172 073 on 31 March 2019 to 1 159 366 on 31 March 2020.

--- Page 9 ---
The number of driving licences issued increased by 484 856 (3.68%) from
13 174 103 on 31 March 2019 to 13 658 959 as of 31 March 2020.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued increased by
28 561 (2.63%) from 1 085 588 on 31 March 2019 to 1 114 149 on 31 March
2020.

--- Page 10 ---
SECTION A

1. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between January and March of 2019 and 2020 using the
CHoCOR Form. In addition, the report includes information about registered
vehicles, un-roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licence and
professional driving permits issued from the National Traffic Information
System (NaTIS) information. Furthermore, it includes information about
population growth using the 2019 mid-year population estimates from
Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is utilised to
collect fatal road crash data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
is the primary source of the fatal crash data. SAPS provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this, the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

The data is collected through the CHoCOR forms which are submitted to the

Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

--- Page 11 ---
2.3 Data processing

The data is captured and verified for compilation of the consolidated statistical
report. There is a continuous engagement with provinces for validation

purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based mainly on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

--- Page 12 ---
3. FATAL ROAD CRASH ANALYSIS

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes, which
encompasses the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality information per road user group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between two quarters. There was a
decrease of 58 (3%) crashes in comparison to quarter 4 of 2019 and 2020. Six
provinces recorded decreases and three provinces recorded increases. The
highest decrease in fatal crashes was recorded for Free State with 26%
followed by Mpumalanga with 21%. Western Cape province is the only one

with the highest increase of 56%.

--- Page 13 ---
The Figure 1 above indicates the provincial percentage distribution of fatal
crashes for the two quarters. The percentage distribution for Eastern Cape and
Gauteng decreased by 1% from 13% in 2019 to 12% in 2020 and from 20% in
2019 to 19% in 2020. While on the other hand the percentage distribution for
KwaZulu- Natal increased by 1% from 19% to 20% in comparison of the two
periods. Western Cape shows a significant increase of 5% from 8% in 2019 to
13% in 2020.

3.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the fatal crashes per day of the week is given in the table below.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday remain the most affected day of the week by
fatal crashes for both 2019 and 2020. These three days make a contribution of

60% at most to the occurrence of fatal crashes.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and light delivery vehicles with contributions of 46% in 2019 and 40% during
2020. The two vehicle types contribute to high number of fatalities for

passengers.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal road crashes are determined as follows:
human factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that
are valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road

and weather conditions).

14

--- Page 17 ---
The fatal crashes for January to March 2020 showed that human factors
contributed 85% to the occurrence of fatal crashes followed by roads and
environmental factors at 9% and vehicle factors with a contribution of 7%. The

human factors remain to be a challenge for the country.

investigated for the period under review. One-hundred and eighty-eight (188)
persons were killed and two-hundred and fourteen (214) persons sustained

injuries in these major crashes.

The figure below indicates the number of fatalities and injuries sustained
during the period under review in comparison with the previous year. During
the current period there were more major crashes reported and investigated

and fatalities as well as injuries as compared to previous year.
