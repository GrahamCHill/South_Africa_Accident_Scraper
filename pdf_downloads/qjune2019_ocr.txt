1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

¢ To provide final road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced
vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

--- Page 9 ---
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report seeks to provide the final road crash statistics. The performance is
for the period between April - June 2019. The performance per each focus
areas have been provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total number of 2 876 fatalities were recorded for the period between April to
June 2019 from 2 338 fatal crashes. That resulted in a decrease of 15% fatal
crashes and 13% fatalities in comparison to same period in 2018. The most
affected road users were pedestrians and Passengers.

A total number of twenty-eight (28) major crashes were reported and
investigated during this period. Two-hundred and three (203) persons were
killed and one-hundred and ninety-six (196) persons sustained injuries in the

major crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

The number of registered vehicles increased by 242 038 (1.96%) from 12 348
522 on 30 June 2018 to 12 590 560 vehicles on 30 June 2019.

The number of learner driving licences issued decreased by 14 304 (1.20%)
from 1 192 926 on 30 June 2018 to 1 178 622 on 30 June 2019.

SECTION A
. INTRODUCTION

This report is based on information about fatal crashes that were reported to
police stations between April and June 2019 using the CHoCOR Forms. In
addition, the report includes information about registered vehicles, un-
roadworthy and un-licenced vehicles, driving licences and professional driving
permits issued from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS).
Furthermore, it includes information about population growth using the 2018
mid-year population estimates from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) form is used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS) is
the primary source of the fatal crashes data. SAPS Provide the Corporation
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (CAS list) and further to this the
Corporation receive the CHoCOR forms from various police stations. Road
Traffic Management Corporation captures, Processes and verifies the data to

compile a report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms. The forms are then submitted to
the Corporation either by fax, email or through the phone.

--- Page 12 ---
Z

Road Traffic
2.3. Data processing

The data is captured, processed and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with

Provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is mainly based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for in-depth research to be conducted to

\ collect scientific base facts to complement the administrative data.

2:5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are being
used by Road Traffic Information unit to record fatality data on daily basis.

3. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers the data in relation to fatal road crashes. The section will
encompass the number of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors,

fatality data per road user group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison during the first quarters in 2018 and
2019. A decrease of 420 (15%) has been recorded in comparison to the two
quarters of 2018 and 2019 nationally. On a provincial level, all the nine (9)
Provinces recorded a decrease in this regard. The highest decrease in the
absolute figures was recorded for KwaZulu Natal with 178 fatal crashes
followed by Gauteng with 117 fatal crashes.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and LDV’s with contributions of 43% and 21% respectively by June 2019. Both
the Motor cars and LDV’s recorded a decrease of 2% each in comparison of the
two periods. The two vehicle types may contribute to high number of fatalities

for passengers.

3.2. Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users regardless); vehicle factors (are more focussed on the
vehicle itself and they cover issues around mechanical failures; and
environment (include limited visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road
signs, sudden changes in road infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road
and weather conditions).

The fatal crashes for April to June 2019 showed that human factors contributed
88% as compared to 89% recorded during April to June 2018. The roads and
environmental factors recorded 5% in 2018 and 8% in 2019 that showed a
significant increase of 3%.

driver population. The vehicle Population data will encompass the number of
registered vehicles inclusive of the status of their roadworthiness and licencing,
as well as human mobility in terms of the number of persons per vehicle. The
driver population data covers the number of registered drivers including the
status and categories of licences
