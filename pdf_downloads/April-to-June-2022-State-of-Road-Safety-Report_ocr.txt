1. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT

This report is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

e To provide road traffic fatal crashes and fatalities statistics based on the
Culpable Homicide Crash: Observation Report (CHoCOR) Forms and provincial
inputs; and

e To present statistics on registered vehicles, un-roadworthy vehicles, un-licenced

vehicles, driving licence and professional driving permits issued.

--- Page 8 ---

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report provides fatal road crash statistics in South African public roads.
The performance is for the period April to June 2022. The performance per

each focus areas have been provided below.

Road Crashes Data

A total of 3,156 fatalities were recorded between April and June 2022
compared to 3,224 for the same period in 2021. For the same period 2,659
fatal crashes were recorded compared to 2,774 period in 2021. This is a

reduction of 2.7% for fatalities and 4.1% fatal crashes.

A total of twenty-six (26) major crashes were reported and investigated during
this period. One-hundred and seventy-nine (179) people were killed, and two-
hundred and seventy-six (276) people sustained injuries in these major

crashes.

Vehicle and driver population

Registered vehicles increased by 240,989 (1.87%) from 12,913,174 in June
2021 to 13,154,163 vehicles in June 2022.

The number of learners driving licences issued increased by 160,509 (17.15%)
from 936,071 in June 2021 to 1,096,580 in June 2022.

--- Page 9 ---

The number of driving licences issued increased by 49,1936 (3.47%) from
14,161,022 in June 2021 to 14,652 958 in June 2022.

The number of Professional Driving Permits (PrDP’s) issued decreased by
137,251 (11.68%) from 1,175 278 in June 2021 to 1,038,027 in June 2022.

SECTION A
. INTRODUCTION

This report compares fatal crashes reported to police stations between April
and June 2021 and April and June 2022 using the CHoCOR Forms and
information recorded by provinces. The report includes information on
registered vehicles, driving licences and professional driving permits issued
from the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS); and information on
population growth using the 2021 mid-year population estimates from
Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Road crash data collection methodology

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms are used to
collect fatal crashes data on daily basis. South African Police Service (SAPS)
and Provincial Departments of Road and Transport are the sources of fatal
crash data. SAPS provides the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC)
with a list of all recorded fatal crashes (called the CAS list) and further to this
the RTMC receives CHoCOR forms from various police stations; the provincial
departments also submit data on fatal crashes to RTMC. RTMC validates all
inputs for consistency, captures, processes, and verifies the data and compiles

the report.

2.2 Crash Data Flow

Data is collected through the CHoCOR forms and provincial inputs. The data is
then submitted to RTMC.

10

--- Page 11 ---
7

2.3. Data processing

The data is received from the three areas (SAPS, CHoCOR and provinces),
validated, captured, processed, and verified for the compilation of the
consolidated statistical report. There is a continuous engagement with SAPS

and provinces for validation purpose.

2.4 Limitations

The road traffic information contained in the report is based on the fatal
crashes only. There is still a need for collection of all road crashes, traffic
volumes, road conditions, weather reports amongst others to complement the

data currently collected.

2.5 Instruments

The Culpable Homicide Crash Observation Report (CHoCOR) forms and

provincial inputs are used by RTMC record fatality data on daily basis.

3. ROAD FATAL CRASHES

The section covers fatal road crash data. The section encompasses the number
of fatal crashes and fatalities, contributory factors, fatality data per road user

group and major crashes.

3.1 Number of fatal crashes

The table below provides a comparison between the first quarter of the
financial year 2021/22 and first quarter of the financial year 2022/23.
Nationally there has been a decrease of 115 (4.1%) fatal crashes. At a
provincial level 7 (seven) provinces recorded a decrease and 2 (two) provinces
namely KwaZula-Natal and Western Cape recorded increases in fatal crashes.
In terms of decrease in number of fatal crashes the highest decreases were in
Eastern Cape at (-74) followed by Mpumalanga at (-34). The highest
percentage (%) decreases were in Eastern Cape at 20.5%, Northern Cape at
16.5% and Free State at 14.6%.

Figure 1: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per province

The above figure shows percentage distribution of fatal crashes per province.
figures are provided in the figure above. The provinces with the highest
contribution are Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal at 22% and 21% respectively for
2022. More than 40% of fatal crashes for the period under review are from
Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.

3.1.1 Fatal Crashes per Day of Week

The details of the crashes per day of the week are given in the figure below.
The weekend days (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) remain the most
contributors of fatal crashes at an average of 60% fatal crashes from these
three days. Saturdays and Sundays contribute an average of 44% to fatal

crashes.

Figure 5: Percentage distribution of fatal crashes per vehicle type

The vehicle types that contributed the highest to fatal crashes were motorcars
and LDV’s with contributions of 36% in 2022.

3.2 Contributory factors

The contributory factors for fatal crashes are classified as follows: human
factors (defined as a stable, general human abilities and limitations that are
valid for all users); vehicle factors (are focussed on the vehicle itself covering
issues around mechanical failures); and environment factors (include limited
visibility, poorly marked roads, missing road signs, sudden changes in road

infrastructure, gravel road, the state of the road and weather conditions).

Human factors contribute a high percent to fatal crashes. These factors

average 85% contribution for the period under review. Human factors remain a

big concern.
